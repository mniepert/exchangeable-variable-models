enron australia is barred from trading power futures ( updatel )
( adds reason for decision in first paragraph , background
starting in third paragraph )
sydney , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s australian
finance unit was barred from trading in the nation ' s wholesale
electricity futures market because its funding wasn ' t assured , the
securities regulator said in a statement faxed to bloomberg .
the australian securities and investments commission today
removed enron australia finance pty from a register of facility
providers for the market .
enron , the largest energy trader , is expected to file for
chapter 11 protection after the collapse of a planned merger with
dynegy inc . asic said it made its decision because enron ' s credit
rating was downgraded .
` ` enron australia ' s last financial report showed that it is
economically dependent on the credit facilities provided , or
guaranteed by its u . s . parent , ' ' the statement said .
enron australia had previously indicated to asic it had
ceased to enter into new derivative contracts in the market , the
statement said .
the australian wholesale electricity futures market brings
together generators and retailers of electricity .
enron partnership put $ 50 million in company that went bankrupt
2001 - 11 - 30 01 : 02 ( new york )
enron partnership put $ 50 million in company that went bankrupt
houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares climbed 50
percent in 1999 as the energy trader reported profit increases
each quarter , and chief executive kenneth lay predicted ` ` another
excellent year for enron . ' '
lay ' s presentation didn ' t include a fact that might have
been of interest to shareholders . an enron - affiliated partnership ,
joint energy development investments limited partnership , or jedi ,
had invested $ 50 million in a texas company that went bankrupt .
enron has written off the loss .
jedi was among more than 30 partnerships enron used to hedge
risks and move assets and liabilities off its books . losses by
some partnerships led to enron ' s downfall after the company
reported inflating profits by $ 586 million over five years . enron
is on the brink of the largest bankruptcy in history after rival
dynegy inc . abandoned a takeover .
` ` enron was hiding things and tried to deceive , ' ' said rob
plaza , a morningstar inc . analyst who owns no shares . ` ` there is
no way the stock would have reached these levels if they had
disclosed more . ' '
legal and accounting experts said enron should have described
jedi ' s investment in costilla energy inc . , an oil and natural - gas
exploration company , in u . s . securities and exchange commission
filings . that ' s because the man who represented jedi in the
investment , tim detmering , is a managing director of enron and
became a member of costilla ' s board .
related parties
` ` it was a related - party transaction , ' ' said howard schilit ,
president of the center for financial research and analysis , a
group that mines financial statements for accounting red flags .
` ` a footnote should have mentioned that . ' '
enron spokesman eric thode said the company chose not to
identify the costilla investment or report detmering ' s role in sec
filings . he said enron grouped the investment ' s loss with other
results . detmering didn ' t return phone requests for an interview .
jedi gave costilla $ 50 million in return for costilla shares
in late 1998 , according to a lawsuit costilla ' s bankruptcy trustee
filed against enron on sept . 5 in zapata county , texas .
sherry chandler , a lawyer representing the trustee , said
jedi , detmering and other enron executives pledged to invest $ 100
million from the partnership in costilla to help finance
costilla ' s planned $ 410 million purchase of oil and natural - gas
properties owned by pioneer natural resources inc .
an enron affiliate , enron oil & gas co . , operated the pioneer
properties , the suit says . in september 1998 , costilla paid
pioneer $ 25 million toward the purchase , which it forfeited when
enron and jedi didn ' t invest additional money to close the
transaction , the suit says . costilla then faced a cash crunch and
filed for bankruptcy protection .
` financial spiral '
costilla trustees blame enron and jedi for a ` ` financial
spiral that led to collapse , ' ' according to the lawsuit .
louis dreyfus natural gas corp . , based in oklahoma city ,
bought costilla ' s oil and gas properties in june 2000 for about
$ 130 million .
enron reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion during the
third quarter because of partnership losses . the company is
responsible for $ 3 . 9 billion in partnership debts and faces a mid -
december deadline for paying an additional $ 690 million in
partnership debts .

europe ' s first and largest electricity exchange , has closed and
cleared all outstanding trades by enron corp . , the u . s . energy
trader facing bankruptcy .
` ` this has been managed without losses for nord pool , ' ' the

nord pool suspended enron from trading and clearing at 1 : 50
p . m . local time yesterday because the company failed to ` ` post the
margins required . ' ' the u . k . power exchange and the automated
power exchange also excluded enron yesterday .

enron ' s withdrawal from europe shakes a market it helped create
2001 - 11 - 30 05 : 43 ( new york )
enron ' s withdrawal from europe shakes a market it helped create
berlin , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s collapse means
europe ' s energy market , which the company helped create , will
become a riskier place .
with enron facing bankruptcy at home and suspended from the
biggest energy exchanges in europe , utilities are struggling to
fill the gap and complete transactions with the u . s . company .
prices in the u . k . , scandinavia and germany surged and dropped as
traders rushed to buy power and tried to sell it again .
` ` enron was a real ice - breaker in europe , ' ' said ralf
schaefer , a spokesman for rwe ag , the continent ' s fourth - largest
electricity company . ` ` it has been incredibly important for
european trading and for the market in general . ' '
the u . s . trader pounced on europe in 1990 , before most of the
region ' s energy markets opened to competition , building a power
station in northern england . until this week it held a fifth of
europe ' s $ 100 billion - a - year electricity - trading market . customers
include sainsbury ' s plc , a u . k . supermarket chain .
` ` i ' ve been running around all day - - traders are very
busy , ' ' said paul taylor , head of electricity trading at txu corp .
in europe , the largest power trader in the u . k . ` ` we ' ve suddenly
got a lot of positions to sort out . ' '
enron employs 6 , 800 people in europe . job losses in the
region are inevitable , said tony lomas , one of the four
administrators at , the auditing firm
appointed to wind down or sell the houston - based company ' s
european business .
enron owns power stations capable of lighting 4 . 4 million
homes in italy , poland , spain , turkey and the u . k . it supplies
electricity - producing windmills in germany and sweden , and owns a
water utility in the u . k . it brought the first weather derivatives
contract to europe in 1998 .
for the average consumer , enron ' s downfall may be
imperceptible . yet enron ' s trading expertise was the envy of
european utilities such as rwe , electrabel sa and enel spa , which
rushed to hire traders and associated staff . e . on ag , europe ' s no .
2 utility , in march opened a new trading floor in munich .
twice rivals ' size
the u . s . company traded about 300 billion kilowatt hours of
electricity in europe last year . e . on , which said its aim was to
overtake enron as the region ' s largest electricity trader , traded
130 billion kilowatt hours in 2000 .
` ` a lot of players have geared their activities toward enron ,
and may have something to lose if enron falls , ' ' said arnhild
stoevik , an analyst at europower as , an oslo - based energy research
company .
enron ' s suspension from nord pool asa , europe ' s first and
largest power exchange , and from the u . k . power exchange yesterday
led to increased price swings and higher - than - usual volume in the
region . day - ahead prices for off - peak electricity
rose as high as 27 pounds ( $ 38 . 5 ) a megawatt - hour before slumping
to close at 15 pounds .
powernext sa , france ' s fledgling power exchange , said trading
suffered a ` ` cold spell ' ' yesterday . powernext executed its first
trades on monday , and had expected enron to join the exchange in
coming weeks .
most european utilities said their individual exposure to
enron was less than $ 50 million . centrica plc , the u . k . ' s dominant
natural - gas supplier , said it may have to write off $ 43 million .
rwe said it has open positions worth ` ` much less ' ' than 10 million
euros with the u . s . company .
` ` we ' re not going to see a single european electricity
company going down , ' ' said vincent gilles , an analyst at ubs
warburg in london . ` ` but without the liquidity , companies may find
it hard to make money out of trading . ' '
europe ' s banks are also feeling the pinch . abbey national plc
said it ' s owed 115 million pounds ( $ 164 million ) by enron , while
abn amro holding nv , the largest dutch bank , may set aside 110
million euros ( $ 97 . 5 million ) to cover its exposure .
sensing opportunity
rivals see a chance to grab the customers enron may have to
leave behind - - like upm - kymmene oyj , which said it may seek
another company to help manage its risk on electricity prices .
europe ' s no . 2 paper company contracted enron for those services
last december .
` ` the way i see it , there ' s one less competitor and still the
same number of customers , ' ' said brian count , chief executive of
innogy holdings plc , the u . k . ' s largest electricity supplier .
enron supplies power to about 150 , 000 british businesses through
its enron direct unit .
there is also ` ` very serious interest ' ' in enron ' s metals -
trading business in europe , ' s lomas said .
possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore international
ag and the current management of the company , analysts said .
officials there couldn ' t be reached to comment .
the loss of enron may be felt most in germany , home to rwe
and e . on , where the u . s . company controlled as much as 40 percent
of electricity trading . it had lobbied for fair access for foreign
companies starting out in europe ' s largest energy market .
enron won a landmark case in 1999 on the right to distribute
power over the germany ' s grid . its complaints this year spurred
german authorities to probe four utilities for charging too much
to let rivals transport power across their grids .
german households and businesses ` ` may be less willing to
switch suppliers if they have fears of companies going out of
business , ' ' said ulf boege , head of germany ' s antitrust authority ,
at a press conference in bonn yesterday .
federal prosecutors want to monitor sec ' s enron probe , wsj says
2001 - 11 - 30 07 : 40 ( new york )
washington , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - federal prosecutors in
texas and new york told the securities and exchange commission
they want to monitor the sec investigation into enron corp . ' s
accounting practices as a possible precursor to a criminal case ,
the wall street journal said , citing an unidentified source .
if a criminal investigation began , it would most likely take
place in the houston office , though new york could assert
jurisdiction since the company is traded on the new york stock
exchange , the journal reported .
prosecutors haven ' t started their own investigations out of
concerns a criminal probe would cause potential witnesses ` ` to
clam up , ' ' the unidentified source told the journal .
enron is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization
in history . the company is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in
debt and had less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week .

dynegy is under pressure after failed enron buyout , nyt says
2001 - 11 - 30 08 : 38 ( new york )
houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . is having trouble
making a clean break from its buyout offer to energy trader enron
corp . , the new york times reported .
dynegy , whose bond rating is under pressure , may face a
lawsuit from enron and questions from investors about why it
didn ' t scrutinize enron ' s books more closely , the times said .
dynegy ' s decision to back out of the $ 9 billion acquisition leaves
enron on the verge of bankruptcy .
the houston - based rival of enron must now convince investors
and rating agencies that it has less in common with enron than it
said earlier this month , the paper said . with enron out of the
way , dynegy may be able to expand its energy trading business .
however , some worry that enron ' s collapse has revealed previously
undiscovered risks that energy trading companies may face , the
times said .
dynegy ' s efforts to buy a natural gas pipeline that is one of
enron ' s most valuable assets for $ 1 . 5 billion might not pan out
either because enron said it will fight to keep the pipeline out
of dynegy ' s hands , the times reported .

dynegy says pipeline option not dependent on enron ( updatel )
( adds chairman ' s comments in third and fourth paragraphs . )
houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . said it plans to
take over enron corp . ' s northern natural gas co . pipeline unit
next month , even if enron seeks chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
or challenges dynegy ' s decision to call off their merger .
the nov . 9 merger agreement gave dynegy $ 1 . 5 billion in
preferred stock in northern natural gas , as well as the right to
buy all of the common stock of the business for about $ 23 million .
dynegy backed out of the $ 23 billion merger on wednesday and said
it would exercise its right to take over the 16 , 500 - mile pipeline .
enron has said it is reviewing options for northern natural
gas , one of its most valuable assets . enron may sue to keep dynegy
from claiming ownership of the pipeline , a person familiar with
the situation said yesterday . dynegy chairman chuck watson said
yesterday he would rather take over the pipeline than get back the
$ 1 . 5 billion investment .
enron can buy the pipeline back if it pays dynegy
$ 1 . 5 billion , plus interest , within 180 days of the merger ' s
collapse , watson said . enron has been unable to raise enough cash
to ensure it can pay its debts and is having trouble financing
daily operations .
enron is facing bankruptcy after credit rating agencies
lowered the company to junk status , causing customers to take
business to other energy traders . northern natural gas can ' t take
any action , including filing for bankruptcy , without the consent
of dynegy as a preferred stockholder , dynegy said in a statement .
dynegy ' s right to the pipeline ` ` is not dependent on enron ' s
agreement to our right to terminate the merger , ' ' dynegy chief
financial officer rob doty said in the statement . dynegy said
today it plans to complete the pipeline purchase on dec . 12 .
shares of enron fell 25 cents to 36 cents yesterday . they
have fallen 99 percent since mid - october . dynegy fell $ 2 . 32 , or
6 . 5 percent , to $ 33 . 65 . both companies are based in houston .
