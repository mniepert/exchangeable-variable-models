houston - ( dow jones ) - dynegy inc . ( dyn ) terminated its troubled merger agreement with enron corp . ( ene ) , backing away from the deal despite frantic last - minute attempts by both sides to save it .
dynegy wednesday cited enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , convenants and agreements , including the material adverse change provision .
the announcement came after standard & poor ' s cut the beleaguered energy trader ' s debt rating to b - minus , essentially rendering it to junk status .
the downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that enron will be forced to file for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code . that could be a fatal blow for enron , which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive .
standard & poor ' s lowered its long - term rating on enron to b - minus from triple - b - minus , citing fears that dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase of enron .
the collapse of the dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on enron ' s credit profile because of enron ' s limited access to capital at a time when extensive debt restructuring is necessary , s & p said .
" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this doesn ' t reflect a failure for the energy merchant business , " dynegy said in announcing its decision .
however , dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are solid , and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of enron .
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down $ 2 . 91 , or 71 % , to $ 1 . 20 . dynegy , meanwhile , was down $ 4 . 08 , or 10 % , at $ 36 . 81 , also on the big board .
top executives of enron and dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine the two energy - trading companies amid growing signs that enron faced cash - flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business .
talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all - stock transaction after enron ' s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn ' t be as high as originally anticipated . last month dynegy agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
citing a person familiar with the situation , the wall street journal said wednesday that enron ' s board late tuesday had informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered , down more than 50 % from the original offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share .
that latest proposed share - exchange ratio valued enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , or a total of $ 4 . 17 billion . that would compare with the original value of $ 10 . 98 a share , or $ 9 . 33 billion . in exchange for reducing the purchase price , some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company . dynegy also was considering an additional $ 250 million cash investment in enron . dynegy , together with chevrontexaco inc . ( cvx ) , has already injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company .
while struggling to keep the planned merger alive , enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings . enron has a total of about $ 13 billion of debt , of which about $ 9 billion comes due by the end of next year . last month enron said in a filing with the sec that a cut in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain levels - would trigger the need to repay , refinance or cash collateralize facilities totaling $ 3 . 9 billion .
dynegy said wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of enron natural gas pipeline unit northern natural , omaha , neb . , and said it has exercised its right to acquire the unit ' s common shares .
chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , contributed $ 1 . 5 billion to the proposed enron merger , and dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline unit .
northern natural , which owns and operates 16 , 500 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline spanning from the permian basin of texas to the great lakes , has historically been a strong earnings contributor .
dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to dynegy ' s own energy delivery network .

energy markets seen surviving enron ' s woes , but changed

new york - ( dow jones ) - the energy markets built by enron corp . ( ene ) will survive the company ' s troubles , but they won ' t emerge unscathed , traders and analysts said wednesday .
energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the houston - based giant ' s creditworthiness , allowing a more or less orderly withdrawal of enron from the market before ratings agencies wednesday downgraded enron ' s credit to junk - bond levels .
nevertheless , liquidity in the north american natural gas and electricity markets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tightened in general , creating difficulties for some energy traders .
" this doesn ' t spell the end of energy trading , " said one trading manager for an independent power producer . " the market is much bigger than enron , and that ' s why enron fell . this does spell the spell the end of trading for companies that don ' t have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or two as credit requirements are generally tightened , "
moreover , small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their 2002 output with enron earlier this year - when prices were much higher than they are now - will suffer if enron has trouble fulfilling those commitments .
enron warned in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels .
news of enron ' s downgrade added 5 cents to 10 cents to natural gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange , as traders covering short positions sent the december contract to $ 2 . 82 per million british thermal units , traders said .
midwestern and southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due to trading inefficiencies after enron turned off its internet - based trading platform enrononline and higher gas prices .
prices have in all those markets have since fallen , but the moves point to the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders expect should enron exit the market entirely .
kyle cooper , energy analyst at salomon smith barney , said traders will have to present wider bid - offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets in which enron provided critical liquidity .
" one less player , one less market , because of the illiquidity , " cooper said .
at one time , enron accounted for about a quarter of all trade in the north american gas and power markets .

uk : enron - a pioneer of europe ' s new power markets .

london , nov 28 ( reuters ) - u . s . group enron , on the brink of collapse on wednesday , has been a pioneer of energy dealing in europe and its demise would rob utilities across the continent of a key trading partner .
with a european staff of 5 , 000 , offices in most major cities and a lavish headquarters overlooking london ' s buckingham palace , enron created the trading culture now embraced by previously sceptical european utilities as markets open up to competition .
until recently , enron had accounted for about 30 percent of german wholesale power trading . it was also a major player in uk gas and electricity and nordic power , and was driving forward a fledgling french power market .
" on average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties , " enron ' s director of continental power trading gregor baeumerich told reuters in an interview last month , days before the group was plunged into its current crisis .
britain ' s forward gas market rallied on wednesday as it emerged that a rescue deal from smaller rival dynegy had unravelled and enron looked to be skating dangerously close to bankruptcy .
enron ' s list of trading partners included major utilities such as german giants e . on and rwe and the uk ' s innogy and british energy
u . s . companies with trading desk in europe , such as txu , aep , dynegy and duke energy , also traded with enron .
the company ' s enrononline internet trading platform , suspended earlier on wednesday , set the standard for online trading , offering a blueprint followed by utilities and brokers .
enron did about 60 percent of its trade through the platform .
the group ' s presence in europe is not confined to trading . the company has around 4 , 000 megawatts of power generation , spanning italy , poland , greece and the uk where it owns one of the biggest plants at teesside .
the company built a reputation for hard - nosed trading expertise in europe ' s previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost evangelical .
in the summer , flushed with confidence , the company placed a bmw sports car in the lobby of its london office , a prize for employees successful in recruiting fresh talent for the enron cause .

usa : wrapup 2 - enron near collapse after dynegy pulls out .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . swooned at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . blew apart .
dynegy accused enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeover agreement was negotiated on nov . 9 , invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the all - stock deal valued at $ 9 . 3 billion at the time .
shares of enron , recently ranked no . 7 on the fortune 500 list of the biggest u . s . companies , had lost most of their value in the past three weeks , and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on enron ' s bonds to junk status by the time dynegy made its announcement .
enron ' s latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free - fall that began innocently enough with the announcement of a $ 638 million quarterly loss six weeks ago . surprise disclosures , including the admission it overstated earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 and kept huge debts off its balance sheet , led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almost $ 80 billion a little more than a year ago .
on wednesday , its market value was less than $ 500 million .
in response to dynegy ' s announcements and credit rating downgrades , enron said it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations .
kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said the company was evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesses .
the loss of enron ' s investment - grade credit rating forces some $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to come due immediately , a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $ 5 . 5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat . enron said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to " continue as a going concern " were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status .
it became increasingly clear , as dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal , that enron ' s tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a sticking point , sources close to the negotiations said .
" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business , " dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement .
dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline with the $ 1 . 5 billion it and partner chevrontexaco put into the deal .
dynegy said it stopped trading with enron as of wednesday morning , pegging its exposure at $ 75 million .
a bad sign came earlier on wednesday , as energy traders said operations had stopped at enron ' s once highly lucrative online trading system , enrononline . the unit accounted for up to 90 percent of enron ' s earnings , and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that dynegy coveted most in its planned $ 9 . 3 billion all - stock takeover .
risk management failures
enron , which touted itself as an agile risk manager , found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks .
the partnerships , which included top enron executives and are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation , provided financing in exchange for guarantees that enron ' s stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment - grade . but they came back onto the balance sheet with a vengeance , as enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations as its shares and credit fell .
enron shares plunged $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , to 61 cents on wednesday , as the new york stock exchange twice halted trading of enron shares before announcements affecting the company . it ' s stock has fallen more than 98 percent this year .
the stock peaked at $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 , riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena .
" they ( enron ) entrapped the sophisticates , " said robert stovall , senior strategist at prudential securities , referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors . " i think this is going to become a classic case . "
stovall , with nearly 50 years of wall street experience , said he could not recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of enron .
" you would have to go to pre - sec days for that , " he said , referring to the creation of the sec in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 .
the final cuts
standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch all cut their ratings on the fallen energy trading giant ' s debt to junk status . s & p said it had lost confidence in enron ' s ability to complete the merger with dynegy , and said bankruptcy was a " distinct possibility " if the merger fails .
andre meade , a commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on enron and the deal , said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace in recent weeks , and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they wanted inside enron .
" the numbers were not enough to soothe them , " said meade , who downgraded enron to " sell " from " hold " on wednesday . " this company should have been downgraded to junk weeks ago . the ratings agencies had given them several weeks , and they just couldn ' t hold out anymore . "
dynegy on nov . 9 said it would take over enron in a deal valued at about $ 10 . 41 per enron share . chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , pledged to immediately pump $ 1 . 5 billion into enron to bolster its withering finances .
deal advisers j . p . morgan chase and citigroup have already contributed $ 1 billion to the deal , and were expected to have to put up after enron was rebuffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash .
representatives of dynegy and enron had haggled over new terms for the takeover late into tuesday , including a buyout offer half the original price , sources close to the talks said .
enron ' s crash began when it said it would take $ 1 . 01 billion in writedowns and charges against its third - quarter earnings for failed investments . it later admitted that it had to reduce stockholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion to extract itself from partnerships in which now - ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow the managing partner .
those deals , in which fastow earned about $ 30 million in management fees , are the subject of an sec investigation and the . worse yet for enron , it was required to restate its earnings going back four years , shaving off $ 600 million in the process .

new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp ' s internet - based energy and metals trading system was shut down on wednesday , shortly after a leading credit - rating agency downgraded the company ' s debt to " junk " status , energy traders said .
it was not clear whether the enrononline trading system was halted deliberately or by a technical problem . enron officials were not immediately available for comment .
" we were watching the board and suddenly it went blank , " said one northeast natural gas trader . activity on enrononline was halted just after 11 a . m . ( 1600 gmt ) , the trader said .
energy traders said the standard & poor ' s announcement that it was downgrading enron debt triggered a brief spike in new york mercantile exchange natural gas futures , to $ 2 . 82 per million btu , but prices later slipped to the low - $ 2 . 70 s , still up more than 11 cents from tuesday .
" we spiked on the enron news . people ran in to cover any exposure because of the uncertainty . i think they ' re expecting the company to file for chapter 11 ( bankruptcy ) , " said one midwest gas and power trader .
" the enron ( stock ) halt sent a shock through the ( power ) market and all trading stopped . the enron guys pulled all their numbers ( on enrononline ) , " another trader at a houston - based energy firm said .
u . s . natural gas and electricity firms have been steadily scaling back deals with enron for several weeks as fears mounted about the former energy giant ' s credit standing .
" people have been balancing their risk exposure over the last few weeks , " another midwest trader said .
enron was by far the largest u . s . natural gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some 20 percent of daily trade in those markets .
but since last month , when the company became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of financial dealings with partnerships , the houston - based company ' s market share has steadily eroded .
enrononline until recently accounted for about 60 percent of the daily trade volume handled by enron .
enron shares were briefly halted on the new york stock exchange this morning following the credit - rating downgrade . after the stock reopened , it dropped $ 2 . 84 to $ 1 . 30 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares closed tuesday at $ 4 . 14 .

washington , nov 28 ( reuters ) - the chairman of the u . s . house energy and commerce committee said on wednesday he could not see how the government could come to the rescue of enron corp . , near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , " said billy tauzin , republican of louisiana .
but he said the government must watch carefully whether the troubles of the houston - based enron - once ranked as the nation ' s largest trader of electricity and natural gas - had implications for u . s . energy supplies and pricing .
tauzin noted that enron had been a " very big contributor " to energy supplies in california , which was rocked last winter by a tenfold jump in wholesale electricity prices , a string of black - outs and the bankruptcy of the state ' s largest utility .
" we ' ve got to watch that very carefully , obviously . we don ' t want to be in another session next year trying to deal with energy problems in california as a result of some of the events that are occurring right now with enron , " tauzin said .
the underlying cause of california ' s problems last winter was widely seen as the state ' s badly written electricity deregulation law , which did not allow power companies to pass through higher wholesale electricity costs to consumers .
tauzin said enron ' s decline was unfortunate . " it ' s a sad story . it ' s been a hugely successful enterprise . "
" i would hope they could work it out . we can ' t simply step into every bad market decision and every bad financing decision that occurs in american corporations in this country and work it out for them . we have to count on them to figure it out themselves . "
" our job is going to be to make sure in policy we haven ' t left a breach open where consumers are going to end up short or overpriced in the process , " he added .
