washington - ( dow jones ) - any merger deal that may emerge between dynegy inc . ( dyn ) and enron corp . ( ene ) will face a complicated and time - consuming regulatory - review process , legal experts said thursday .
any equity deal would require approvals from numerous u . s . federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators , as well as survive canadian and european antitrust reviews , energy attorneys contacted by dow jones newswires said .
a merger would require approvals from the federal energy regulatory commission , securities and exchange commission , department of justice and federal trade commission . and the illinois commerce commission likely would weigh into the mix , since dynegy owns illinova ' s illinois power co .
any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by enron ' s ownership of portland general electric co . while enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) , a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications .
a key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential enron - dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail , the attorneys said .
financially wounded enron is the nation ' s largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines .
dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing .
the transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at ferc , where the merger application would challenge the commission ' s merger - review policy , attorneys said .

usa : newpower shares advance on revised guidance .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 8 ( reuters ) - national power and gas marketer newpower holdings inc . revised its 2001 loss guidance downward on thursday and saw its stock post its best one - day gain in two months .
the projection came in newpower ' s report of a third quarter net loss of $ 67 . 1 million , or $ 1 . 15 per share , compared to a net loss of $ 69 . 9 million , or $ 2 . 96 per share for the third quarter of 2000 .
analysts had expected a per - share loss of $ 1 . 15 to $ 1 . 18 , according to research firm thomson financial / first call , which put the consensus at $ 1 . 16 .
purchase , new york - based newpower is the parent of the new power co . , which says it is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in the united states . it said total customers increased 155 percent to 805 , 000 compared to the third quarter of 2000 . revenues were $ 54 . 7 million in the latest quarter , an increase of 201 percent from the third quarter of 2000 .
during the third quarter , newpower said , it gained about 80 , 000 new customers through the company ' s marketing efforts , primarily in the residential sector . newpower recently increased its emphasis on small business customers and at the end of september had over 25 , 000 small business accounts . newpower expects this to increase to more than 35 , 000 by the end of the year .
providing revised guidance for the rest of the year , the company said it expects a net loss of $ 41 million to $ 46 million or a loss per share of 65 cents to 73 cents for the fourth quarter . the full year net loss is estimated to be between $ 210 million and $ 215 million , or $ 3 . 55 to $ 3 . 63 per share .
analysts ' estimates of the year per share loss range from $ 3 . 68 to $ 3 . 74 , resulting in a consensus per share loss projection of $ 3 . 71 .
newpower said it projects the year - end customer count will be between 840 , 000 and 860 , 000 , of which the fourth - quarter increase is expected to be achieved entirely through marketing .
it said the revised forecast reflects a reduction in the number of customers the company expects to acquire through portfolio acquisitions and the impact of delays in switching texas customers to newpower , partly offset by the company ' s modified marketing strategies and continued cost reductions .
newpower shares reached a high of $ 1 . 25 in thursday afternoon trading and were still up 48 . 15 percent , or 39 cents , at $ 1 . 20 in the final half hour of trading .
the company is 44 percent owned by enron corp . , newpower ' s largest provider of electricity and natural gas .

new york , nov 8 ( reuters ) - utility holding company firstenergy corp . sold $ 4 billion of five - , 10 - and 30 - year debt on thursday , helped by investors ' preference for defensive sectors as the u . s . economy stalls .
firstenergy was able to lower its borrowing costs , trimming yields from initial indications . the sale originally was expected to offer generous yields as heavy bond issuance , weak wholesale power prices and investor jitters over the troubles of energy trading firm enron corp . weighed on the utility sector .
akron , ohio - based firstenergy will use proceeds for corporate purposes and to help pay for its recent purchase of morristown , new jersey - based gpu inc . . firstenergy purchased gpu for about $ 4 . 5 billion in cash and stock , plus the assumption of about $ 7 . 2 billion in debt . the sale closed on tuesday .
utility bonds are typically viewed as a conservative investments because of the industry ' s stable income during uncertain economic times . the sector has been under a cloud , though , as houston - based enron has struggled with a cash squeeze and writedowns from off - balance - sheet transactions .
" enron was held up as a model , growing extremely quickly , and the recent financial disclosures are just a shock , " said kelly perl , a project director at new york utility consulting firm applied economic research .
spreads , or the yield gaps between utility bonds and u . s . treasuries , have widened about 0 . 15 to 0 . 20 percentage point over the past two weeks , while spreads on gas and pipeline companies have widened about 0 . 30 percentage points , strategists said .
sale terms
firstenergy sold $ 1 billion of 5 . 5 percent five - year notes at 99 . 888 cents on the dollar , yielding 5 . 526 percent or 1 . 98 percentage points more than similar - maturity u . s . treasuries . it also sold $ 1 . 5 billion of 6 . 45 percent 10 - year notes at 99 . 651 cents on the dollar , yielding 6 . 498 percent or 2 . 25 percentage points more than treasuries , and $ 1 . 5 billion of 7 . 375 percent 30 - year bonds , yielding 7 . 389 percent or 2 . 45 percentage points more than the old long treasury bond .
initial price guidance had called for spreads as high as 2 . 20 , 2 . 35 and 2 . 60 percentage points more than treasuries for the five - , 10 - and 30 - year debt .
firstenergy ' s sale was helped by a 0 . 50 percentage point interest rate cut by the u . s . federal reserve on tuesday and signs that the fed could cut rates again .
" there is the perception that the fed is going to aggressively ease and err on the side of caution , " said peter palfrey , portfolio manager for loomis sayles & co . in boston . investors are betting that the fed will engineer an economic recovery , helping corporate profits and spurring price gains in corporate bonds , palfrey said .
analysts said firstenergy ' s acquisition of gpu should benefit its credit quality .
" it adds further diversity to their cash flow from regulated distribution companies , " said fitch analyst robert hornick .
falling wholesale power prices also should benefit firstenergy , hornick said .
" they ' re not a big seller of wholesale energy at this point , " hornick said . " they don ' t own generation facilities and need to buy ( electricity ) in the market , so to the extent wholesale prices are lower , they can benefit , " he said .
standard & poor ' s rates firstenergy ' s senior unsecured notes " bbb - minus , " its lowest investment grade . moody ' s investors service rates firstenergy ' s long - term debt " baa 2 , " roughly one notch higher , while fitch rates them " bbb . "

usa : wrapup 1 - enron , dynegy confirm possible merger talks .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 8 ( reuters ) - enron corp . , plagued by investor doubts and under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances , said on thursday it was talking with power trading rival dynegy inc . about a possible merger .
the company , whose stock and credit ratings have plummeted amid an uproar about questionable business transactions , admitted it made bookkeeping errors and restated earnings for the last four years .
it also said former chief financial officer andrew fastow , who abruptly left the company last month , had made $ 30 million managing partnerships linked to the deals . the deals , which were off the balance sheet , are now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission for possible conflict of interest .
two other executives , managing director and treasurer ben glisan and enron division general counsel kristina mordaunt , were both believed to have links to the fastow - led partnerships and have been fired , the company disclosed .
the announcements threw a spotlight on enron ' s stark situation , in which the nation ' s top energy trader has gone from wall street darling to pariah in a few weeks and now faces a cash crunch so dire it is seeking a merger with the much - smaller dynegy .
its credit ratings have fallen to near - junk levels in recent weeks , making it difficult to get money to boost investor confidence and back the trading operations that provide 90 percent of enron ' s income . the company reportedly has been seeking investors to provide a cash infusion for an equity stake .
moderate premium
word about a possible dynegy - enron deal leaked out on wednesday , and on thursday the two companies confirmed talks about a possible " business combination " were underway , but said no agreement had been reached .
sources told reuters that the two texas rivals , whose headquarters are a few blocks apart in downtown houston , were talking about a stock swap with a moderate premium for shareholders and a $ 1 . 5 billion capital infusion from chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 . 5 percent of dynegy .
the stock swap is valued at about $ 8 billion , or about $ 10 a share , the new york times reported on thursday .
a merger would catapult dynegy to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by enron . last year , the company had $ 29 billion in revenues , compared to $ 100 billion for enron .
for enron , it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace .
enron stock has lost $ 19 billion in market value since its crisis began in mid - october and was down another 45 cents to $ 8 . 60 in thursday trading . dynegy shares rose $ 3 . 87 to $ 36 . 87 .
enron restated its earnings going back to 1997 , saying its auditors advised that the off - the - balance sheet deals in question should have been included in the company ' s financial statements .
the restated results reduced enron ' s net income by $ 591 million , or 22 percent , from 1997 to 2000 , and increased its debt by $ 628 million , or 6 percent , after two of the partnership ' s financial statements were consolidated into enron ' s earnings .
enron said the restatement reflects a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction to shareholders ' equity that touched off the current controversy when the company offhandedly disclosed it last month . angry shareholders suddenly worried that enron was hiding other liabilities in its complex financial statements and began demanding more information .
in a statement , enron chief executive ken lay said the company hoped it had allayed wall street fears with thursday ' s announcements .
" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , " he said .
analysts , wary after last month ' s surprise revelations , said enron may have more to release , but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information .
" it ' s an attempt to come clean , " said raymond moore , an analyst with weatherly securities .

( repeating to show in headline , lead that enron is trading lower )
new york ( afx ) - shares of dynergy inc were sharply higher , while enron corp lost ground in midsession trading after the two companies confirmed that they are holding merger talks .
at 12 . 25 pm , dynergy was up 3 . 17 usd , or 9 . 6 pct , at 36 . 17 , enron fell 0 . 34 usd , or 3 . 7 pct , to 8 . 71 usd and chevrontexaco dropped 0 . 18 usd to 87 . 10 . the djia was up 110 . 22 points at 9 , 664 . 59 , the s & p 500 index gained 12 . 88 points to 1 , 128 . 68 and the nasdaq composite rose 34 . 35 points to 1 , 871 . 88 .
enron share price today was hurt after the company announced a restatement of its net income from 1997 to the third quarter of 2001 . the revisions were , for the most part , reductions in the bottom - line figure .
the 8 bln usd tie - up talks , which come at a time when enron is being investigated by the us securities and exchange commission and the markets are losing faith in the energy trader , are seen as particularly positive for dynergy .
analysts see a tie - up as highly accretive for dynergy , which is 26 pct owned by chevrontexaco , with many synergies also possible .
banc of america analyst william maze , who rates dynergy ' strong buy ' , said : " if this transaction comes to fruition , we would be aggressive buyers of dynergy given its accretive nature as well as the lifting of enron ' s credibility issues that has been plaguing the entire industry . "
cibc world markets analyst william hyler , who rates enron ' buy ' , added : " the move would also catapult ( dynergy ) into a leadership role at what could prove near the bottom of the gas / power pricing cycle . "
on the other hand , enron ' s position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat .
to that end , dynergy would provide a yet unspecified cash injection , believed to be approximately 1 . 5 - 2 . 0 bln usd , to improve enron ' s standing and shore up its finances .
chevrontexaco , which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger , also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company .

uk : rivals eye enron ' s metals trading business .
by andy blamey
11 / 08 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 9 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy trading giant enron corp . , whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash , may lose or offload its metals business , senior industry sources said on thursday .
in the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company ' s metals customer base .
" there are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market , " a senior metals market source told reuters on thursday .
such a move for enron ' s metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle , the source added .
" we do not comment on rumours , " an enron spokeswoman said , declining further comment .
other enron metals assets were also said to be in play , including the henry bath warehousing company , which operates lme - registered warehouses in the uk , the netherlands , singapore and the united states .
major player
houston - based enron became a major player in the metals trade in may last year when it acquired mg plc , a leading independent international metals dealing firm in london , in a deal worth around 300 million pounds .
the company is a ring - dealing member of the london metal exchange ( lme ) , able to participate in open - outcry floor trade , and is active in screen - based metals trade via its enrononline platform ( www . enrononline . com ) .
the company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform emetra ( www . emetra . com ) , having sold its holding to other emetra shareholders this summer .
but while enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector , base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses .
the company ' s third - quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest , minority interests and taxes ( ibit ) from " europe and other commodity markets " - which includes metals and steel alongside european gas and power , among others - of $ 53 million , unchanged from the year - earlier period .
this compares with ibit from enron ' s gas and power market - making operations and merchant energy activities in north and south america of $ 710 million over the same period .
but the third - quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company ' s shares is a $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to off - balance sheet transactions .
on thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $ 613 million of the company ' s reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year .
the company ' s stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since enron released its earnings results on october 16 , falling to nine - year lows amid concerns about the company ' s ability to raise cash .
the story added an extra twist on wednesday as news broke that u . s . - based energy trading and marketing firm dynegy inc . was in talks to buy out enron .
against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation , fuelled by the company ' s decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by enron europe .
unlikely to remain intact
any decision by enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see enron metals remain intact , traders said .
" they paid $ 450 million for mg . would they get $ 450 million for enron metals ? i don ' t think so , " said one .
" why buy the whole concern when you can cherry - pick the best traders and the clients will follow ? " added another .
an increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some enron clients to jump ship .
" we ' ve picked up a fair amount of small and mid - sized trade - type business in europe from people who ' ve said ' i ' m not going to be told just to trade on a screen , ' " said one trader .
another trader said : " a lot of this business revolves around who you ' ve been trading with and talking to over a period of time . it ' s about individuals , " he said .
" enron online . . . should be seen as an ' added value ' product , not as the only way of trading . customers still want to talk to their broker , and are willing to pay commission for the service , " the senior source said .
enron ' s financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options , the first trader said .
" as a customer , you want to place your business where there ' s financial stability . if a company isn ' t financially stable , you ' ll move elsewhere . "
enron ' s trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company ' s financial situation , said a trader at one lme brokerage .
" people aren ' t particularly concerned about short - term trading ( with enron ) , but when it comes to otc business done outside the clearing market they ' re backing off a bit , " he said .

houston - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ( ene ) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 , as the embattled energy company and dynegy inc . both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination .
in a filing thursday with the securities and exchange commission , enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods .
