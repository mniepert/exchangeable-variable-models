( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones in particular , our role as auditors of year - end financial statements presented by management . we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities , train our people and enhance quality .
when a client fails , we study what happened , from top to bottom , to learn important lessons and do better . we are doing that with enron . we are cooperating fully with investigations into enron . if we have made mistakes , we will acknowledge them . if we need to make changes , we will . we are very clear about our responsibilities . what we do is important . so is getting it right .
enron has admitted that it made some bad investments , was over - leveraged , and authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors , credit - rating agencies , and trading counter - parties . enron ' s trading business and its revenue streams collapsed , leading to bankruptcy .
if lessons are to be learned from enron , a range of broader issues need to be addressed . among them :
- - rethinking some of our accounting standards . like the tax code , our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science . in the process , we have fostered a technical , legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported .
enron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what ' s going on in a business . like many companies today , enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities ( spes ) and other off - balance - sheet structures . such vehicles permit companies , like enron , to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet . wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings , which are well known to analysts and investors .
as the rules stand today , sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements , even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards . basing the accounting rules on a risk / reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity ' s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet ; certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide . the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years . it ' s time to rethink the rules .
- - modernizing our broken financial - reporting model . enron ' s collapse , like the dot - com meltdown , is a reminder that our financial - reporting model - - with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings - per - share number - - is out of date and unresponsive to today ' s new business models , complex financial structures , and associated business risks .
enron disclosed reams of information , including an eight - page management ' s discussion & analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report . some analysts studied these , sold short and made profits . but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that , although they were confused , they bought and lost money .
we need to fix this problem . we can ' t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial - reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past , but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what ' s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future .
the current financial - reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age . that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few . there were no derivatives . no structured off - balance - sheet financings . no instant stock quotes or mutual funds . no first call estimates . and no lou dobbs or cnbc .
we need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model . disclosurs needs to be continuous , not periodic , to reflect today ' s 24 / 7 capital markets . we need to provide several streams of relevant information . we need to expand the number of key performance indicators , beyond earnings per share , to present the information investors really need to understand a company ' s business model and its business risks , financial structure and operating performance .
- - reforming our patchwork regulatory environment . an alphabet soup of institutions - - from the aicpa ( american institute of certified public accountants ) to the sec and the asb ( auditing standards board ) , eitf ( emerging issues task force ) and fasb ( financial accounting standards board ) to the pob ( public oversight board ) - - all have important roles in our profession ' s regulatory framework . they are all made up of smart , diligent , well - intentioned people . but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today ' s complex financial issues . standard - setting is too slow . responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession .
all of us must focus on ways to improve the system . agencies need more resources and experts . processes need to be redesigned . the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review , and address them . some criticisms are off the mark , but some are well deserved . for our part , we intend to work constructively with the sec , congress , the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest .
- - improving accountability across our capital system . unfortunately , we have witnessed much of this before . two years ago , scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects . the dot - com bubble cost investors trillions . it ' s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us .
in particular , we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises . millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security .
of course , investors look to management , directors and accountants . but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders . they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework - - and walk away from companies they don ' t understand . they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep . for our system to work in today ' s complex economy , these checks and balances must function properly .
enron reminds us that the system can and must be improved . we are prepared to do our part .

fall of a power giant : dynegy hits back at enron with lawsuit - - - claim is that failed merger entitles concern to get northern natural gas

striking back in what is shaping up as a nasty fight , dynegy inc . sued enron corp . to try to take control of enron ' s flagship northern natural gas co . pipeline system , as investors continued to punish dynegy for its failed gambit to acquire enron .
the suit was filed the day after enron filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code and filed a $ 10 billion lawsuit against dynegy , claiming its down - the - street rival breached its merger agreement by breaking off the deal this past week .
the suits escalate a war of words between the two houston companies over who was responsible for the merger breakup that contributed to enron ' s tumble into bankruptcy - court proceedings and they threaten to be a serious distraction for dynegy , another energy - trading highflier .
credit agencies continue to penalize dynegy for gambling on an effort to buy enron , and dynegy ' s stock is off more than those of other companies with significant energy - trading operations . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , dynegy shares fell $ 3 . 18 to $ 27 . 17 each , below their 52 - week low .
" there is no question that something as high - profile as this will attract senior management ' s attention for some time , " said robert grossman , chief credit officer with debt - rating agency fitch inc . , which has had dynegy on its credit watch since dynegy agreed to the merger . " the very fact that the lawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors ' minds and it could limit the upper end of the stock for awhile , " says ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg .
still , dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy - trading business . dynegy ' s president and chief operating officer , steve bergstrom , who worked for enron in the early 1980 s , is considered one of the brightest lights in energy trading and dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipelines , production and power - plant capacity to complement its trading operations .
as enron was cratering last week , dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron ' s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural - gas - supply deals . as enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgorge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers , " dynegy was a direct beneficiary , " an enron trader said yesterday . " when we couldn ' t do it , people just thought ` let ' s go across the street and talk to dynegy . ' " he said dynegy was offering the best deals late last week .
since oct . 1 , the number of customers executing agreements on dynegydirect , dynegy ' s online trading platform , has increased 20 % and dynegy ' s physical trading business also has increased , mr . bergstrom told analysts yesterday . " we continue to experience a clear flight to quality by customers , " he said . " we will not be distracted by these events . "
many enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion of the company . " these traders are going to be looking for jobs and maintaining their relationships will be very important , and they may even be interviewing at dynegy , " said jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons thomson financial / datastream

how many lawyers does it take to file a chapter 11 bankruptcy - law proceeding ?
in the case of enron corp . , about 30 . that ' s the number of attorneys new york law firm weil , gotshal & manges , enron ' s bankruptcy counsel , says it had on the case before it was filed over the weekend in federal bankruptcy court in new york .
enron ' s chapter 11 filing , one of the largest in corporate history , is also apt to be one of the most lucrative - - for lawyers representing the company and those counseling its creditors , as well as an expected army of financial advisers and turnaround pros .
the slackening economy and the burst of large chapter 11 cases - - five of the 15 biggest chapter 11 s of all time have been filed this year - - have left the formerly insular bankruptcy bar busier than ever and with a new cachet . with demand growing , rates are rising , reaching $ 700 an hour for the top lawyers . that is starting to put bankruptcy lawyers in the same league with merger specialists and trial attorneys . the pending chapter 11 case of pg & e corp . ' s utility unit this spring , some experts predict , could generate legal and other fees topping $ 400 million .
" the phone has been jumping off the hook , " said andrew rahl , a partner and bankruptcy specialist at anderson kill & olick in new york . mr . rahl says his firm already has been retained by one client in the enron case , who he declines to identify , and is actively negotiating with two others .
besides weil , enron has retained new york firm skadden , arps , slate , meagher & flom as " special counsel " to represent its outside board members , among other tasks . heading the team : mergers specialist peter atkins , best known for representing a special committee of rjr nabisco inc . in the $ 25 billion takeover fight celebrated in the best - selling book , " barbarians at the gate . "
enron ' s bank creditors , who hold a chunk of the company ' s $ 13 billion in debt , have lined up two large wall street firms of their own . shearman & sterling is advising longtime client citigroup inc . ' s citibank while j . p . morgan chase & co . has retained davis , polk & wardwell , and partner donald bernstein , a restructuring specialist who has represented the bank in the pending bethlehem steel corp . chapter 11 proceeding , also in new york , among others . among other major creditor firms is boston ' s bingham dana , which has been retained by the structured - finance unit of general electric co . ' s general electric capital corp .
litigation between enron and its erstwhile merger partner , dynegy inc . , is also expected to trigger many billable hours . dynegy , which sued enron yesterday , seeking the right to complete the acquisition of enron ' s crown jewel pipeline system , has retained houston firm baker botts , along with akin gump strauss hauer & feld , based in dallas and washington . enron , which launched its own pre - emptive lawsuit in bankruptcy court on sunday against dynegy , is represented by weil securities litigator greg danilow and corporate chief thomas roberts , who recently handled amr corp . ' s acquisition of trans world airlines in delaware bankruptcy court .
martin bienenstock , weil gotshal ' s chief bankruptcy lawyer on the enron case , said rates of firm partners likely to be involved in the matter range from $ 450 to $ 700 an hour . mr . bienenstock , who charges a $ 675 hourly rate , has recently represented holders of millions in bonds issued by excite @ home corp . , as well as such bankruptcy - law debtors as ames department stores inc . and g - i holdings inc . , an asbestos concern . with 80 bankruptcy lawyers , one of the largest such law - firm practices in the country , he added , " you can do a lot more .

fall of a power giant : now is the time for creditors to vie against each other

enron corp . ' s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marks the beginning of complicated jockeying as hundreds of creditors seek to get the most they can at the expense of other creditors .
filings expected to be submitted to the court subsequent to enron ' s original petition sunday will at least partially lift the veil of secrecy that has long hovered over the company ' s dealings . but for now , few of enron ' s many unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover , thanks to enron ' s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked away in partnerships not consolidated onto the company ' s balance sheet .
in its chapter 11 filing , enron corp . listed $ 13 . 15 billion in debt . when combined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedings , on - balance - sheet debt totals $ 31 . 24 billion . some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional $ 27 billion in off - balance - sheet and contingent liabilities . the combined list of creditors attached to enron ' s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long .
precisely because there are so many claims , the contesting among enron ' s creditors is expected to be especially fierce . while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims - - with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid , the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom - - bankruptcy proceedings aren ' t always set in stone .
" chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the rights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses , " said stephen case , a bankruptcy lawyer with davis polk wardell in new york .
in coming weeks , enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors , who buy distressed debt , for information about the ultimate value of the company .
until now , many distressed - debt players have been on the sidelines , citing the impossibility of understanding enron ' s business operations , the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron .
" traditionally , immediately after a bankruptcy filing , a flurry of opportunistic investors will look at the company , " said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy lawyer with coudert brothers in new york . " it is easier to analyze after bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available . "
" after a filing , the paper tends to get concentrated , " added mr . case of davis polk . " many institutional investors have to dump their securities because they don ' t want to be seen in [ or aren ' t allowed to hold ] defaulted paper . so they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands . "
complicating the negotiations : claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests , reflecting enron ' s combination of physical and financial assets - - thousands and thousands of financial contracts , whose value is uncertain and likely to be highly contentious .
usually , it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a share of the assets . in order to compete , the savviest creditors , such as the distressed - debt funds , which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices , engage in a variety of strategies . for instance , they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn - out legal battle unless concessions are made . or , because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement , one party may buy up others ' claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class - - enough to influence the entire outcome .

houston - - a lawsuit on behalf of members of enron corp . ' s employee - retirement plan has been expanded to allege that the company ' s independent auditor , arthur andersen llp of chicago , " knowingly participated in enron ' s breaches of fiduciary duty " by actively helping enron conceal its true financial condition and the imprudence of investing in enron stock .
the amended suit , filed yesterday in federal court in houston by the gottesdiener law firm in washington , seeks to recover $ 1 billion in plan losses as well as the return of fees paid to andersen , which totaled $ 52 million in 2000 , the law firm says .
at least three other lawsuits have been filed on behalf of enron ' s 401 ( k ) retirement plan members .
enron filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy - court protection from creditors on sunday .
" as enron collapses , we are obviously going to have to look elsewhere to get some justice for enron employees , " said eli gottesdiener , lead counsel for the plaintiffs .
spokesmen for arthur andersen and enron said the companies don ' t comment on pending litigation .

two years ago , standing outside a half - built baseball stadium , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay announced that the high - flying energy giant would pay roughly $ 100 million over 30 years to put its name on the new home of the houston astros .
that was well before fatal questions arose about enron ' s questionable finances . but after that , enron never had a chance . it was destined to join fruit of the loom inc . , trans world airlines , psinet inc . and others that spiraled downward after emblazoning their brand names on sports stadiums . it ' s as if putting a corporate name on a stadium is an act of such hubris that the sports gods demand retribution .
for fruit of the loom , that meant filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999 , three years after putting its pro player athletic - wear label on miami ' s football and baseball stadium . twa took down its shingle from the home of football ' s st . louis rams earlier this year , after being acquired out of bankruptcy by american airlines . and psinet , a new - economy telecom firm that agreed in 1999 to pay more than $ 100 million over 20 years for naming rights to the baltimore ravens ' new football stadium , filed for bankruptcy protection in june .
call it the stadium - naming jinx . " as soon as you put your name on something , you might as well go to the lawyers and draw up the bankruptcy petition , " jokes paul swangard , managing director of the warsaw sports marketing center at the university of oregon .
shares of 3 com corp . , the maker of computer - networking equipment , were trading at $ 39 . 50 on sept . 7 , 1995 , when it agreed to pay $ 1 million a year to put its name on san francisco ' s windswept candlestick park , generating howls of local protest . six years , several corporate reorganizations and one tech downturn later , 3 com last month said it had had enough and told football ' s san francisco 49 ers it didn ' t want to renew . 3 com shares closed at $ 4 . 66 in 4 p . m . nasdaq stock market trading yesterday .
compaq computer corp . doubled down on stadiums , attaching its name to indoor arenas in houston , its hometown , and in san jose , calif . now , compaq is struggling to sell itself to hewlett - packard co . edison international , namer of the anaheim angels ' edison field , saw its southern california edison co . unit flirt with bankruptcy after california deregulated its electricity market . most recently , anc rental corp . , parent of national car rental , filed for bankruptcy protection on nov . 13 , raising questions about the home of hockey ' s florida panthers .
the hex is fodder for sports fans from the boardroom to the bleachers . " will it create some kind of stigma , and will people ask about it ? yes , " says richard sherwood , president of front row marketing services , in newtown , pa . , which works on stadium - naming deals .
in baltimore , many fans had never heard of psinet before its name was affixed , in big purple letters , to the ravens ' stadium . psinet ' s bankruptcy filing is " an embarrassment and predictable result of the shortsighted greed of ownership , " says attorney and football fan neil brafman . he suggests renaming the ballpark " creditors ' committee stadium . " in houston , longtime astro season - ticket holder steve cross proposes that enron field be renamed " enron folds . "
" that way you ' d only have to change a couple of letters , " says the 58 - year - old financial adviser .
on - the - field success is no antidote . the astros won their division this year . the ravens won the super bowl in january , as psinet was sliding toward bankruptcy . their predecessors as nfl champs were the rams , playing under twa ' s soon - to - be - gone logo . " maybe i should run a regression to see if i should bet the team and short the company , " says new york hedge - fund manager seth tobias . mr . tobias says he likes just two of the stadium - namers as stocks : qualcomm corp . and fedex corp .
