houston ( afx ) - enron corp said the securities and exchange commission has opened a formal inquiry into the company ' s transactions with entities connected with related parties .
in a statement , enron said " the sec has opened a formal investigation into certain of the matters that were the subject of recent press reports and that previously were the subject of its informal inquiry . "

in addition to reviewing the transactions in question , the special committee is charged with communicating with the sec and recommending any other actions it deems appropriate .
" i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors ' questions and concerns , " said enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay .
" responding to the sec offers us an additional opportunity to achieve this same goal for investors , and we will cooperate fully . we will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the sec ' s investigation . "

the lure of cashing out lucrative stock options won ' t cost enron any more employees any time soon . the company ' s share price has fallen too far too quickly , leaving the options underwater .
the company ' s shares traded as high as $ 80 early this year . by july the price had dropped to around $ 50 , leaving employees with options that were virtually worthless . so enron told employees it would issue new options in august .
but the company ' s share price continued to fall as more and more bad news came out . the new options issued in august , when the share prices were around $ 40 , are now underwater also .
now that the options are out of the money , enron employees are more vulnerable to the lure of other companies , peterson said .
enron could face another problem in keeping key people . its employees work under two - year contracts . if they leave enron before their contracts expires , a noncompete clause could prevent them for working for a competitor .
some of those contracts will expire at the end of the year . without the incentive of lucrative stock options , enron might have a difficult time getting employees to agree to new contracts with a noncompete clause , peterson said .
an enron spokeswoman said the company isn ' t planning to issue more new options to employees .

houston , we have a problem : how much is enron worth ?

new york - ( dow jones ) - with billions of dollars shaved off of the market capitalization of enron corp . ( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ?
the answer is far from easy .
ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand .
just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities .
one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets .
by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services .
wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today .
not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk .
enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division .
enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock .
in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division .
but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants .
through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things .
what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure .
enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations .
without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing .
also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles .
using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation .

enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation

houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover .
shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover .
others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said .
on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 .
enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings .
some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week .
the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .
earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades .
potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said .
duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit .
" shell tried to be in the merchant energy arena and didn ' t really succeed , " he said . " to buy into an established franchise must be attractive to shell . "
enron officials did not immediately return telephone calls from the associated press on wednesday .
while enron ' s stock price has made it attractive , coale said the energy marketer ' s problems present a substantial drawback .
" i would fault a company for acquiring enron with all of this hanging over it , " she said . " there are too many uncertainties . "
grubert said he believes enron has the ability " to weather the storm and restore their enterprise on their own . "
since reporting its disappointing third quarter losses , enron has been negotiating with banks to establish new credit lines . the company last week decided to cash in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence .

usa : few signs of domino effect among enron ' s peers .
by andrew kelly
10 / 31 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , oct 31 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy traders such as dynegy inc . and aquila inc . have taken a knock as a result of enron corp ' s recent woes , but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered .
" the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , " said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . " i don ' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , " he said .
enron ' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company ' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks .
and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said .
" enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , " said prudential securities analyst carole coale .
uncomfortable with disclosure
coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron ' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron ' s profits .
el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants .
analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron .
el paso ' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company ' s earnings .
dynegy ' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy ' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors ' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio .
asked about dynegy ' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any " related party transactions " .
former high - fliers shunned
analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies ' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines .
in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks .
on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an " asset - light " philosophy .
williams ' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke ' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market .
j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface .
" enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn ' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , " he said .
credit lyonnais securities ' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was .
" trading companies have always had a history of winning big and losing big , " he said . " i think the days of the big valuations are over , " he added .

waste management will start pulp and paper trading tomorrow
2001 - 10 - 31 16 : 52 ( new york )
waste management will start pulp and paper trading tomorrow
houston , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - waste management inc . , north
america ' s largest trash hauler , will start trading paper and pulp
tomorrow to limit the effects of price fluctuations of recycled
materials and offer a service its biggest rivals don ' t provide .
in the past three years , waste management has reduced its
exposure to price swings by placing 75 percent of its recycled -
commodity sales under long - term , fixed - price contracts . still , the
company ' s revenue from recycling fell 38 percent to $ 154 million
in the second quarter .
chief executive officer maurice myers is hoping the trading
business will help stabilize recycling revenue even when prices
for cardboard , newspaper and aluminum cans fall . trading allows
waste management to further limit its own exposure to prices , as
well as offer contracts to customers who want to lock in prices .
` ` what waste management is doing is going to reduce the
company ' s risk and their customer ' s risk , ' ' said thomas leritz , an
analyst at banc of america capital management , which owns more
than 1 million shares of waste management . ` ` i think it ' s a smart
move . it ' s a reflection of the new management team . ' '
myers joined the company in november 1999 as it struggled to
track costs from acquisitions . he has put new financial - systems
software in place and made other efforts to cut costs . the company
has also raised prices where it ' s the dominant hauler .
myers ' s efforts , along with the sale of overseas businesses ,
have helped the company regain regard among investors . the shares
have risen 22 percent in the past year .
pulp and paper
most of waste management ' s solid - waste customers produce or
consume pulp and paper . waste management collects , processes and
sells more than five million tons a year of paper , plastic , glass ,
aluminum and other metals .
recycled - cardboard prices fell 62 percent to $ 48 a ton in the
second quarter from $ 125 a year earlier , and the price for
recycled newsprint fell to $ 55 a ton from $ 90 , myers said in
august . prices were little changed from the second quarter to the
third quarter , said steve ragiel , waste management ' s vice
president of recycling .
waste management , which will report third - quarter results
next week , had expected to begin trading in the third quarter . its
plans were delayed because it took longer than expected to find
people to run the operation , raigel said .
jeff harbert , formerly of enron corp . , is heading the
operation along with two other enron traders . enron , also based in
houston , has created the largest business of trading commodities
including electricity , natural gas , pulp and paper .
risk management
waste management ' s initial focus in the trading business will
be on managing its own price risk . it probably only will complete
five to 10 trades in each of the first few months , raigel said .
the company hopes to set fixed prices for the commodities it
picks up , then sell those commodities to a third company , such as
a paper producer , at a higher set price .
` ` we ' ll get with a counter party such as a paper mill or a
consumer - products company and cut a deal , ' ' raigel said . ` ` we can
find a paper mill that wants to lock in a fixed price on what they
buy and what they sell . they get a minimum return on their
investment and greater control on their raw material costs . ' '
the company hasn ' t said how much it expects to make from
trading . analysts aren ' t expecting the business to contribute
significantly to waste management ' s earnings .
` ` they are looking at it as a good time to get in on trading
but i don ' t see it as a major contributor to their business , ' '
said stewart scharf , an analyst with standard & poor ' s equity
group . he rates waste management ` ` accumulate ' ' and doesn ' t own
shares .
republic services group inc . , the no . 3 u . s . waste company ,
contracts with individual mills to supply recycled commodities at
fixed prices , but hasn ' t started a trading operation , spokesman
will flower said .
allied waste industries inc . , the second - largest trash hauler
in north america , said it has no plans to get into trading .
` ` we ' ll leave trading to people like enron , ' ' allied waste
spokesman michael burnett said .

enron ends 10 - day skid with 25 % jump

october 31 , 2001
houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked wednesday after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target .
enron added 25 percent , or $ 2 . 74 , to close at $ 13 . 90 . more than 43 million shares changed hands , making the stock the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange .
a . g . edwards ' analyst michael heim warned wednesday against buying enron shares . he noted that enron ' s troubles could be hurting its trading operations , the company ' s strength .
" people interested in betting on ene should ask themselves this - - if a person offered to double your money when a coin lands heads and take away half your money when it is tails , would you take the bet ? what if the person flipping the coin is a magician you don ' t trust ? "
a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . an enron spokesman said the company doesn ' t comment on such matters .
enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped .
john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris , said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point .
" however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase , " he said .
olson pointed out that enron ' s heavy losses over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday .
" mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron , " he said . " mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today . "
taking bets
art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers . " it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle . "
on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business .
" it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly , " smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a " look - back provision , " which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value .
smith said he could see either general electric ' s ge capital or royal dutch shell making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report .
" ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this , " smith said . " and shell always keeps us guessing . "
olson also included aig and citigroup as potential acquirers .
" enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture , " he said .
smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive .
" even if enron went away , it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging , " he said .

enron has said it is seeking new sources of credit as the
company tries to assure trading partners and rating agencies that
it can meet day - to - day obligations and keep its investment - grade

company may be a takeover target . still , enron stock is down 83
percent this year .
moody ' s investors service last week lowered enron ' s long - term
debt to two notches above junk status and placed enron ' s
