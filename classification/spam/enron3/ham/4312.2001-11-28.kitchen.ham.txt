( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - now that enron corp . ' s credit and debt ratings have fallen to junk status , crippling what once was the largest u . s . energy trader , observers are pointing fingers , and wondering what took the top three u . s . credit rating agencies so long to act .
" the rating agencies are at fault here for waiting so long and thinking they could hold the deal together , " said tom burnett , a director of merger insight , a research and analysis firm . " that ' s not their job . there ' s not one new piece of information available today that wasn ' t available last week . "
the agencies - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch - denied being influenced to keep enron ' s once investment - grade ratings , or they declined to discuss the issue .
observers , though , said investment banks arranging enron ' s now - dissolved merger with once - smaller rival dynegy inc . - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - had been fighting to preserve those ratings . they now stand to lose millions of dollars of advisory fees with the merger ' s collapse .
" s & p and moody ' s have stated that they ' re not going to be the cause of problems for a company , and in my opinion waited until dynegy decided not to proceed with the merger , " said sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . in philadelphia . egan - jones on wednesday cut its own debt rating for enron to " c , " one notch above default .
anger grows
prices on enron ' s distressed bonds had been in a tailspin for several sessions , and after wednesday ' s cuts they fell by more than half . traders bid them on wednesday near 25 cents on the dollar , with often triple - digit yields .
" i do get the feeling there is a lot of anger and feeling that something should have occurred before " wednesday , said mary ann hurley , vice president of fixed - income trading at d . a . davidson in seattle . " there was talk in the markets that the absence of official statements from dynegy and enron ( on ) tuesday should have been taken by the rating agencies as a clue that the merger was about to fall apart . "
that happened on wednesday .
within about a two - hour period , the rating agencies cut their senior unsecured debt ratings for enron - to " b - minus " by s & p , to " b 2 " by moody ' s , and to " cc " by fitch .
almost simultaneous with the fitch downgrade , dynegy announced it had backed out of the $ 9 billion merger .
the three big rating agencies are paid by companies to assess their ability to repay debt . many companies need these ratings to raise money from investors . sometimes , though , the agencies face criticism for being too slow to act , or being susceptible to outside pressure .
indeed , in january they were criticized for waiting for actual defaults before downgrading california utilities pacific gas & electric co . and southern california edison to junk status .
role of agencies
with regard to the proposed enron - dynegy merger , on nov . 8 , a day before the merger was announced , top citigroup and j . p . morgan officials met with moody ' s , a person familiar with the meeting said . a day later , moody ' s cut enron ' s rating , but not to junk .
john diaz , a moody ' s managing director , denied facing new pressures this week . " in any rating activity , we ' re discussing developments with the companies , so we ' ve been in touch with the companies as we normally would do , " he said . " we have not had contact with the banks . "
ron barone , an s & p director , denied getting pressure from banks this week to hold off on a rating downgrade .
" none whatsoever , " he said in a conference call . " no substance at all . we have not been in contact with the banks . "
meanwhile , glen grabelsky , a senior director in fitch ' s policy group , said " our conversations with the issuers and the agents are confidential . "
diaz and grabelsky said their respective agencies did not decide until wednesday morning to downgrade enron .
" there wasn ' t one specific event to trigger the downgrade , " said diaz . " in the last couple of days our concerns were heightened given the rate of erosion of the ( enron ) franchise , and the declining probability the merger would be consummated as originally expected . "
grabelsky said : " when we lost confidence in the transaction , that ' s when we started preparing to notify the markets . "
d . a . davidson ' s hurley said the delays could be understandable .
" given that the merger or buyout by dynegy wasn ' t officially called off " until wednesday , she said , " it would have been really hard for the rating agencies to move ( enron ) to junk status when there was a buyout that was pending . "

usa : update 1 - enron names two to new litigation committee .

houston , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on wednesday named two outsiders to a new litigation committee that will evaluate claims in shareholder lawsuits as the troubled energy trader totters at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history .
analysts said one would have to go to the days before the securities and exchange commission was formed in the 1930 s to find a corporate unraveling of the magnitude that enron currently faces .
the drop in the value of enron ' s stock - to 60 cents a share at one point wednesday from an all - time high $ 90 . 56 15 months ago - has attracted a flood of suits alleging the misleading of investors to inflate the stock price to the benefit of corporate executives .
enron said raymond troubh , a new york - based financial consultant who has been a non - executive director of more than 25 public companies , was elected a director to chair the special litigation committee .
william powers jr . , dean of the university of texas school of law , who joined enron ' s board in october , also will serve on the litigation committee , the company said in a statement .
lawsuits have been filed against enron and top management after a series of surprise disclosures , including the admission the company erred on its financial statements .
earlier wednesday , dynegy inc . terminated its merger agreement with enron , causing enron shares to close down $ 3 . 53 , or 85 . 27 percent , at 61 cents .

new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . , the troubled energy trading firm , hired new york - based investment bank blackstone group for advice on corporate matters , according to a person familiar with the situation .
enron , which is threatened with collapse after rival dynegy inc . on wednesday scuttled a proposed $ 9 billion purchase of the company , hired blackstone late last week , the source said .
enron could not be immediately reached for comment . blackstone declined to comment .
blackstone , which has advised troubled companies including xerox corp . , chiquita brands international inc . and globalstar telecommunications inc . , provides advice on reorganization and debt restructuring , as well as mergers and acquisition services .

usa : metals traders lament loss of enrononline liquidity .

new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - u . s . metals dealers lamented the loss of a leading online trading platform after crippled enron corp shut down its enrononline system wednesday , but they said it might present an opportunity to grab market share in base metals brokerage business .
things quickly unraveled for the once giant commodities trader wednesday when cross - town rival energy trader dynegy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it , saying conditions had changed since the takeover was agreed on almost three weeks ago .
unless enrononline comes back on - line , dealers who used the internet - based system will have to swiftly migrate their business to other brokerages , market sources said .
" you ' re hoping you are going to be able to do the business ( done formerly on enrononline ) . that was a usable platform and it was easy to trade at any time - it was an around - the - clock system . that is going to dry up , " a new york broker said .
houston - based enron said it indefinitely suspended future operation of enrononline on wednesday . u . s . and european traders said it closed down shortly after standard & poor ' s cut the financially troubled houston - based company ' s credit rating to " junk " status .
now , base metal markets could be poised to lose , at least temporarily , a degree of liquidity during off - hours , after the new york mercantile exchange and london metal exchange close in the afternoon .
" people are going to make adjustments , go back to the way it was before enrononline , and either there is going to be some other kind of quoting ability or the markets are going to be quiet after the exchange hours , " the broker told reuters .
the question remains whether any of enron ' s competitors would step up to fill the void .
a spokesperson at energy and precious metals platform , which offers physical and cash - settled trading in gold , silver , energy and power products , said ice would accommodate customers if they demanded trading in base metals products .
" if after - hours trading in ( base ) metals is something that their customers want to see on the ice system , then they ' ll look into seeing how they can implement it , " the spokesperson for atlanta - based ice said .
" their market participants pretty much dictate what is on the system , and that is how it works with metals as well , " she said .
one of ice ' s partners , mirant , said on wednesday that ice trading volume had increased 30 percent last month as players flocked to ice as an alternative to enrononline .
a midwestern base metals trader said markets would feel strong ripple effects from enron ' s problems , although players seemed immediately puzzled at how to react .
" it should really affect futures markets , and that could mean business for their ( enron ' s ) competitors , " said the trader .
an enron metals trader in new york on wednesday declined to comment when asked about the outlook of the company ' s trading .
enron metals acquired mg plc in 2002 , taking over its positions on the lme and its sizable physical metal book .
enrononline until recently accounted for about 60 percent of the daily trade volume handled by enron .
" nobody wishes for this to happen because enron have good people and they did business in a professional way - that ' s my opinion , " said the midwestern trader .

new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - stocks sank on wednesday as energy trader enron corp . teetered on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions in u . s . history and added more fuel to the debate swirling around the market ' s powerful run - up .
" the market has come awfully far , awfully fast , " said jon brorson , director of equities for northern trust , which manages more than $ 300 billion . " enron is weighing on it , too . i think people are a little squeamish as to the reverberations , and it ' s a great excuse to take some profits . "
enron plunged more than 85 percent in frenzied trading after rival dynegy inc . pulled out of its planned $ 9 billion takeover of the beleaguered energy trader . credit rating agencies slashed enron ' s bonds to junk status and shoved the once mighty company another step closer to bankruptcy .
enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants citigroup inc . and jp morgan chase & co . inc . , which may suffer losses of more than $ 400 million combined on their lending to the energy trading group , according to at least one analyst .
gold stocks rose as skittish investors sought out safe havens .
the blue - chip dow jones industrial average surrendered 160 . 74 points , or 1 . 63 percent , to 9 , 711 . 86 , the largest drop in about a month and the lowest close since nov . 12 . the broader standard & poor ' s 500 index slid 20 . 98 points , or 1 . 83 percent , to 1 , 128 . 52 . the technology - laced nasdaq composite index dropped 48 points , or 2 . 48 percent , to 1 , 887 . 97 .
enron dragged on the market as questions swirled around a strong rally that has lifted stocks well off the sept . 21 lows reached in the aftermath of the attacks on the united states . investors , still expecting an economic recovery in 2002 , pocketed profits on worries that share prices are getting too far ahead of prospects for corporate earnings .
" the market felt it was getting a little too optimistic a little too quickly and there ' s recognition of the many , many risks in this environment , " said milton ezrati , a senior strategist at lord abbett & co . , which oversees $ 40 billion .
losers outpaced winners by a ratio of 2 to 1 on the new york stock exchange and nasdaq . more than 1 . 4 billion shares traded on the big board and more than 1 . 8 billion on the nasdaq .
economic conditions were still sluggish in late october and early november in the wake of the sept . 11 attacks , according to a federal reserve " beige book " report - an anecdotal snapshot of the economy based on reports from the fed ' s 12 regional banks . the fed added the slowdown deepened in most regions , outweighing signs of recovery in a few areas .
enron plunged $ 3 . 53 to 61 cents after snagging a year high of almost $ 85 late last year . the stock ' s trading volume soared to more than 181 million shares during the regular session , setting a new record for any stock for a single day on the new york stock exchange .
negative disclosures about its finances have strangled the once - proud energy giant , which was forced to lower its reported earnings by $ 600 million over the past four years as a result of questionable off - balance - sheet transactions .
enron " entrapped the sophisticates , " said robert stovall , senior strategist at prudential securities , referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors . " i think this is going to become a classic case . "
dynegy , off $ 4 . 92 at $ 35 . 97 , pulled out of its deal to rescue enron , saying conditions had changed since the takeover was agreed on almost three weeks ago . dynegy had planned to buy its rival for about $ 9 billion in stock , but the collapse of enron ' s stock led dynegy to invoke escape clauses allowing it to get out of the deal .
j . p . morgan , down $ 2 . 30 at $ 37 . 50 , and citigroup , down $ 2 . 75 at $ 47 . 80 , pulled the dow down as investors worried over their exposure to enron , which could be facing bankruptcy . the two investment banks accounted for more than one - fifth of the blue - chip dow ' s losses .
the standard & poor ' s natural gas index sank 9 . 36 percent , reflecting the losses by enron and dynegy and other sectoral issues such as el paso corp . , down $ 3 . 59 to $ 44 . 91 , and kinder morgan inc . , off $ 1 . 03 to $ 47 . 60 .
the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index tumbled 4 . 70 percent . chip leader intel corp . lost 55 cents to $ 31 . 76 . semiconductor shares have surged in the past two months as investors hoped they would be the first to benefit from an economic recovery .
major u . s . airlines sank as the sector pulled back from recent gains fueled by a slump in oil prices . the s & p airline index surrendered 2 . 76 percent .
continental airlines inc . fell $ 2 . 40 to $ 21 . 70 after an announcement of a public share offering that will add 12 percent more stock . us airways group inc . fell $ 1 . 58 to $ 6 . 42 after the unexpected resignation of its chief executive on tuesday .
nexell therapeutics inc . surged more than 220 percent , or $ 1 . 65 to $ 2 . 40 . the drug developer said its experimental drug for a rare blood ailment has been granted " orphan " drug status by u . s . regulators . a drug company receives seven years of u . s . marketing exclusivity if an orphan drug is approved for sale by the food and drug administration .
sri / surgical express inc . tanked 41 percent , or $ 10 . 35 , to $ 14 . 63 . the medical supplies company said it restated quarterly results , cutting reported earnings below wall street estimates . it also said it lost customers and failed to expand business as it had anticipated .
flextronics international ltd . added 80 cents to $ 26 . 35 after the contract manufacturer said business was " good " and it was comfortable with quarterly estimates .

usa : enron falls victim to the deregulation it preached .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
san francisco , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . , once the champion of energy deregulation , has fallen victim to the very volatility that often accompanies the transition from an orderly , regulated marketplace to one that follows the harsh laws of supply and demand .
enron , until recently the nation ' s largest energy trader , stood at the brink of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . fell apart .
" enron is in some ways the victim of its own success , " said gerald keenan , lead energy strategy partner at pwc consulting , part of . " all this wouldn ' t have occured if the market wasn ' t deregulated . "
enron was one of the earliest and most aggressive advocates of power deregulation , which breaks down traditional utility monopolies by letting customers choose their electricity provider , banking on competition to drive down prices .
its aggressive strategies gave enron 20 percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market , and enron was ranked no . 7 on fortune magazine ' s list of the biggest u . s . companies .
the downfall
but in recent weeks , enron ' s credit and debt spiralled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused its investors to lose faith .
the partnerships , which included top enron executives , are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation .
in a fluid , competitive marketplace , punishment comes quickly . enron ' s share price closed at 61 cents on wednesday , down $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , from a peak of over $ 90 in august 2000 , after the top three u . s . rating agenices downgraded enron to junk status .
" there are winners and losers in deregulated markets and people who champion them are not necessarily those who will be around in the end , " keenan said .
as more business and mounting profits fell into enron ' s hands , the company took on a air of invicibility .
despised by some market players , many of its trading partners nevertheless were willing to go out on a limb because of enron ' s good reputation , smart traders , and high - flying share price .
enron ' s core business of trading electricity and natural gas relies highly on creditworthiness , and much of its trading was backed by a corporate guarantee , a kind of standby iou .
once that credit guarantee began to be be doubted , credit managers pulled the fire alarm and reduced their exposure .
" up to about two months ago , an enron corporate guarantee was seen by many as money in the bank . then the whole house of cards came down , " keenan said .
people began looking at enron more closely , especially since october when a series of negative disclosures about the company ' s finances forced the company to lower its reported earnings by $ 600 million over the last four years as a result of questionable off - balance sheet transactions .
enron ' s trading business - its crown jewel - has also suffered from lower volumes as wary trading partners shifted business away from the cash - poor and credit - threatened enron .
what now ?
if enron ' s fallout has a significant affect on the regulated companies it did business with , regulators and policymakers could slow down the pace of power deregulation .
but if the damage is confined to the wholesale trading market , there will not be as much impact , analysts said .
so far , 23 states and the district of columbia have moved to deregulate their retail power markets , although nearly one third of them have delayed the onset of competition partly due to california ' s failed free market experiment .
analysts also said if enron is no longer a major player in the large customer market , where it has been very effective , deregulation is not likely to proceed as quickly .
" it ' s a perception issue . enron ' s struggle may have adverse consequences on retail choice even though it has very little to do with it , " said sharon reishus , an associate director of north american power at cambridge energy research associates ( cera ) , an independent research firm based in cambridge , massachusetts .
" this puts us more into the muddle of whether deregulation is good or not . "

usa : northwest natural files to acquire enron utility .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
salem , ore . , nov 28 ( reuters ) - northwest natural gas co on wednesday said it had applied with oregon regulators to acquire utility portland general electric , a unit of troubled energy giant enron corp .
in a statement , northwest natural gas made no mention of the crisis at pge ' s parent and the growing fears enron could be forced into bankruptcy after its credit ratings were slashed to junk status and a rescue by rival dynegy inc . collapsed on wednesday .
but analysts have said that a bankruptcy filing by cash - strapped enron could complicate the proposed sale of oregon ' s largest utility and constrain its ability to buy power for customers if credit concerns deepen .
ratings agencies took different positions on how pge ' s own credit rating would be affected by enron ' s financial crisis .
moody ' s investor services cut the credit ratings of pge on wednesday , citing concerns about the utility ' s ability to remain insulated from the collapse in investor confidence in enron .
but another major ratings agency , standard & poor ' s , excluded pge from a downgrade of enron and subsidiaries , citing protective restrictions in the relationship between the utility and its parent .
northwest natural gas agreed on oct . 8 to acquire pge , the state ' s largest utility , for around $ 1 . 8 billion plus about $ 1 . 1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock .
enron ' s stock plunged more than 80 percent on the new york stock exchange wednesday to around 76 cents . despite several trading halts , turnover surged to near 166 million shares , shattering the record for a single day trade in a stock on the new york stock exchange .
northwest natural was due to hold a conference call for investors at 1330 pst / 1630 est to discuss the filing with the oregon public utility commission .
shares in northwest natural were trading down 54 cents at $ 23 . 80 in late trading on the new york stock exchange .

los angeles - ( dow jones ) - energy companies said wednesday they have the right to liquidate their contracts with enron corp . ( ene ) , based on enron ' s bonds being downgraded to junk status wednesday morning by the major ratings companies .
companies such as bp plc ( bp ) , calpine corp . ( cpn ) , edison international ( eix ) , pg & e corp . ( pcg ) and sempra energy ( sre ) said they have the right to liquidate their positions with enron , but they haven ' t decided yet whether to do so . master agreements generally would force a choice between liquidating all or none of a counterparty ' s trades with enron .
" our contracts have a provision that gives us the right to begin the liquidation process if chapter 11 becomes imminent , " said a spokesman for bp . bp hadn ' t decided whether to take that step as of wednesday afternoon .
the decision rests more on whether liquidation is advantageous for particular energy companies , not on whether a liquidation event has occurred . not only did standard & poor ' s corp . and moody ' s investors service inc . deeply downgrade enron debt wednesday , but s 323 - 658 - 3874 ; jason . leopold @ dowjones . com

new york - ( dow jones ) - j . p . morgan chase & co . ( jpm ) and citigroup inc . s ' ( c ) outstanding paper weakened marginally wednesday afternoon , after major ratings agencies lowered enron corp . ' s ( ene ) credit rating to junk and potential acquirer dynegy inc . ( dyn ) nixed a deal .
during afternoon trading , the spreads to treasurys on j . p . morgan and citigroup outstanding bonds were around 11 basis points wider . the bank sector in general was trading seven to eight basis points wider .
both citigroup and j . p . morgan chase invested a considerable amount of equity in enron to facilitate the company ' s proposed merger with dynegy .
shortly after the downgrades were announced , dynegy ended its merger agreement with enron .
j . p . morgan and citigroup committed $ 800 million to enron , around $ 270 million of which was unsecured lending , said richard strauss , bank analyst at goldman sachs group inc . , said .
standard & poor ' s was first out of the box - cutting enron ' s senior unsecured debt to single - b - minus from triple - b - minus , lowering the company to junk status , on concerns over the merger with dynegy . moody ' s cut enron ' s senior unsecured ratings to b 2 from baa 3 and fitch cut the rating to double - c from triple - b - minus - also speculative .
" there is concern in the market about sectors that have exposure [ to enron ] , whether they are pipelines or financials , " said brendan burke , corporate credit analyst at asb capital management . " anyone who has enron exposure is focused solely on that today . "
market analysts , however , question the extent that this will have on the banking sector .
" much of the exposure is secured and the capacity to absorb any potential losses is strong , " said michael destefano , senior banking analyst at s 201 938 - 2087 richard . bravo @ dowjones . com

point of view : enron mess is no long term capital mgmt

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - the unraveling of the planned merger between enron corp . ( ene ) and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) is going to hurt , no doubt .
but before discussions of " systemic risk " and other doomsday scenarios gain too much of a foothold , it ' s worth pointing out that the enron mess is no long term capital management .
the death of the enron - dynegy deal is probably tantamount to the demise of enron , too . and that eventuality , should it come to pass , is going to have repercussions beyond one or two energy - trading companies . so it ' s fair enough that this news pulled down stocks of all kinds wednesday .
yet the deal ' s demise and troubled enron ' s likely subsequent fate isn ' t a call on the broader value of stocks , whose fortunes remain tied to other fundamentals ( more on this later ) .
the bottom line : a major corporation with about $ 62 billion of assets seems destined to fail . in some ways enron could indeed end up being like the implosion of hedge fund long term capital management , since so much of enron ' s assets are involved in trading .
and it ' s for sure that the still relatively new industry of trading energy commodities like gas and oil - the so - called merchant energy business - is in shock and will have to regroup .
stepping back a bit from the energy business , some big - name banks and other firms may end up with some bad debts if enron ends up in bankruptcy , as most industry observers now expect .
individual investors , including mutual - fund holders unlucky enough to own some power - company shares , will also take a hit , as will some pension funds . all told , holders of enron stock have lost m
