new york ( afx ) - enron corp shares were sharply lower , down more than 8 pct at midsession , as investors continued to fear that the company ' s dealings with the ljm partnership could bring heavy financial reprisals following the opening of a formal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission , dealers said .
at 11 . 55 am , enron was down 1 . 35 usd , or 9 . 57 pct , to 12 . 55 .
the djia rose 61 . 23 points to 9 , 136 . 44 , the s & p 500 gained 8 . 76 points to 1 , 068 . 40 points , the nasdaq composite climbed 23 . 02 points to 1 , 713 . 40 .
yesterday , enron announced the election of william powers jr to the board , to chair a special committee that will examine and take any appropriate actions with respect to transactions between enron and entities connected to related parties .
in addition to reviewing the transactions in question , the special committee is charged with communicating with the sec and recommending any other actions it deems appropriate .
while the investigation might take time to draw a conclusion , the immediate cash crunch enron has been facing is expected to be resolved , said merrill lynch analyst duane grubert .
one step in that direction came following enron ' s announcement that jp morgan and salomon smith barney inc have executed commitment letters to provide 1 bln usd in secured credit lines supported by the company ' s northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline assets .
over time , enron has several other options to raise cash , including cutting its 400 mln usd per year dividend , cutting back on its 1500 mln usd of capital spending , and monetizing its july 2002 right to convert debt into 11 . 5 million shares of eog , said grubert .
the danger for the company now is that a " real or fabricated confidence crisis by enron ' s counterparties threatens near term strength of the merchant segment . competitors could get mean , and could prematurely shun enron , while trying to steal market share , " he said .

new york , nov 1 ( reuters ) - merrill lynch on thursday said it lowered both its mid - term and long - term ratings for enron corp . , the no . 1 buyer and seller of natural gas , to " neutral , " from " accumulate " and " buy , " respectively , due to uncertainty about the u . s . securities and exchange commission ' s investigation into the company ' s financial dealings .
analyst donato eassey said in a research note that while he " has not altered his view of enron ' s fundamentals or its ability to weather the long term storm , " he believes the noise surrounding the sec ' s investigation will overpower any earnings analysis .
" ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside , we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on enron until the investigation concludes , " eassey said .
the houston - based company , whose stock has been sent into a tailspin by the probe , said on wednesday the informal inquiry by the sec had become a full - scale investigation of the company ' s finances .
the stock slumped $ 1 . 34 , or nearly 10 percent , to $ 12 . 56 in thursday morning new york stock exchange trade . in the past week and a half , the stock has dropped to nine - year lows while losing $ 17 billion in market value .

enron obtains $ 1 billion in financing to bolster credit facilities
11 / 01 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
houston - - enron corp . said thursday it has secured commitments for an additional $ 1 billion in financing from units of j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . as the embattled energy trader moves to supplement its credit facilities .
" this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , " said enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon . " we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . "
enron has seen its stock price plummet in a selloff sparked by a loss of investor confidence in the company following big third - quarter write - downs and the disclosure of an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . in morning trading on the new york stock exchange , enron ( ene ) shares were down $ 1 . 67 , or 12 % , to $ 12 . 23 . the stock has declined from a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 .
enron ' s new financing is secured by its northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . assets .
the financing news comes a day after the sec elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . a formal investigation involves the sec ' s enforcement branch going to the five - member commission and obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inquiry .
enron last week disclosed that the sec had contacted the company as part of what it described as an informal inquiry into the fastow - related partnerships . at the time , enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would cooperate fully with the sec - - a position the company has restated repeatedly since .
in turn , enron named william power a director and head of a four - member committee to look into the fastow - related transactions and other matters . power is dean of the university of texas school of law .
enron has consistently said its dealings with the fastow - connected partnerships were legal and properly disclosed to investors . according to enron filings with the sec , the company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and enron stock with entities related to the fastow partnerships . internal partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow , who was replaced as chief financial officer by mr . mcmahon last week , has consistently declined to be interviewed .

houston ( ap ) - troubled enron corp . said thursday it has secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral . but its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation .
in afternoon trading thursday on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down 9 . 3 percent , or $ 1 . 29 a share , at $ 12 . 61 .
after dropping to a nine - year low on tuesday , shares of the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the houston - based company was a takeover candidate .
but after the stock market closed for the day , enron announced the securities and exchange commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest .
the sec is apparently looking into dealings enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements .
on thursday , enron announced its investment bankers had arranged for $ 1 billion in fresh credit lines that it planned to use partly to refinance maturing debts .
" this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , " said jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s new chief financial officer . " we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . "
late wednesday , enron said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation . powers also was elected to enron ' s board of directors .
" i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors ' questions and concerns , " said enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay . " we will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the sec ' s investigation . "
however , duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence .
" with ( stock ) values this low , you ' ve got two camps of investors : guys that hate enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to enron , " grubert said . " it ' s led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold . it ' s not something the company wants . "
enron ' s stock has skidded since the company reported a $ 638 million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago , dragged down by a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to various losses . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by fastow , who was ousted last week .
earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades .
since reporting its disappointing third quarter , enron had been negotiating to establish new credit lines .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s stock price surge , after two weeks of selling , was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report on rumors of a possible takeover of enron .
others might have been buying figuring the stock had hit bottom , she said .
on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 .
potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said .

enron gets new bank loans but its bonds fall further

new york - ( dow jones ) - word that enron corp . ( ene ) had secured $ 1 billion in fresh funds thursday did little to soothe prices on the company ' s outstanding debt securities .
similar to other companies like lucent technologies inc . ( lu ) that have faced short - term liquidity issues this year , enron was forced to put up its assets in order to secure the financing . and the new bank facilities leapfrogged in front of other creditors like senior unsecured lenders .
the houston - based energy and trading company said in a statement thursday that the new financing is supported by enron ' s northern natural gas company and transwestern pipeline company assets . jpmorgan and salomon smith barney were co - arrangers on the credit lines .
enron plans to use the proceeds to supplement short - term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations . the new $ 1 billion of secured credit lines with the more than $ 1 billion in cash currently on the balance sheet " will further solidify enron ' s standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets , " kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said in the statement .
but the need to pledge assets to get the credit lines shows caution on the part of lenders that ' s understandable given enron ' s situation , said susan abbott , a managing director in corporate finance at moody ' s investors service .
