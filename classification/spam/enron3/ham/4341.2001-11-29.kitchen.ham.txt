washington - - if enron corp . goes under , the government is unlikely to throw it a lifeline .
at its peak , enron was a major participant in the country ' s financial and energy markets . but economic and financial policy makers say they aren ' t worried about any broader blow to markets or business activity . despite frequent comparisons to long - term capital management , the hedge fund whose 1998 nose dive panicked global financial markets and triggered an unusual bailout brokered by the federal reserve , there has been so far no public sign of any attempt by the fed , the treasury or energy regulators to take similar action on behalf of enron or its creditors .
officials from a range of economic and regulatory agencies have insisted in recent days that while they have been closely monitoring enron ' s situation , they haven ' t seen any reason to be concerned about possible ripple effects . enron " is just one piece of a very big market , " said john mielke , chief of market surveillance at the commodity futures trading commission . mr . mielke said he saw no evidence that enron ' s problems have disrupted trading on the futures exchanges monitored by the cftc .
" these are deep and pretty big markets that enron is in , " echoed william gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas .
it is too soon to say exactly what the total damage from enron ' s potential demise will be . one danger is that a blowup in the company ' s complex , largely unregulated portfolio of derivatives could infect financial markets in wide and unpredictable ways , just as ltcm ' s did . another worry : that the collapse of a major middleman in natural - gas and power markets could disrupt supplies .
enron does share some characteristics with ltcm , including widespread activities in complicated financial instruments in numerous markets , with little detailed public explanation of those activities , and little regulatory oversight of those trades .
its public disclosures suggest enron ' s exposures are substantial . a quarterly filing listed $ 18 . 7 billion in assets and an equal amount of liabilities related to " price risk management activities " as of sept . 30 . the filing gives no description or breakdown of those amounts and little detail about the derivatives in which enron transacts as a normal part of business . ( a derivative is a financial contract whose value is designed to track the return on stocks , bonds , currencies or other benchmark . ) an enron spokeswoman didn ' t return a call seeking comment .
as enron ' s woes deepened , the government ' s hands were tied in even assessing the situation , in part because the company was part of a coalition of energy companies and banks that lobbied successfully three years ago against cftc efforts to expand regulation of the over - the - counter energy market . enron also worked behind the scene to head off cftc ' s direct regulation of the energy concern ' s enrononline trading operation .
there have been some signs in markets of concerns about enron fallout . interest rates on bonds of utilities and energy companies rose by one - to two - tenths of a percentage point relative to treasurys yesterday . by day ' s end , the dow jones industrial average was off 160 . 74 points , a decline blamed in part on the enron news .
those are relatively small hiccups . the betting is the impact of enron ' s troubles on the financial system will be widespread but thin . enron was a favorite borrower among lenders , and its loans were among the most widely syndicated among the banking system , both at home and abroad . for example , a $ 2 . 25 billion credit facility arranged for enron in may by citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . was distributed to 50 different institutions , according to loan pricing corp . , a credit - market research company . those syndication members sold off chunks of that debt to other investors , according to a banker at one of the underwriters .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement that it has $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines . while this exposure is expected to smart , it represents a small fraction of j . p . morgan chase ' s total assets of $ 715 billion . citigroup declined to comment on its exposure to enron , but officials familiar with the matter said the bank ' s exposure is similar to that of j . p . morgan chase .
beyond financial fallout , a concern is the potential impact on energy markets and what that could do to the economy . enron ' s troubles could hamper efforts to end the recession if the company ' s difficulties make it impossible for it to deliver natural gas or electricity to its customers .
natural - gas prices rose sharply yesterday in the minutes after three major credit - rating agencies downgraded enron ' s rating and dynegy inc . said it was calling off its purchase . but the move quickly reversed when traders digested gas - inventory numbers released in the afternoon that showed utilities have stored enough gas to meet demand ahead of the winter heating season .
" we ' ve seen no interruptions in physical deliveries and no pricing reaction in the futures markets that you could attribute to enron , " said scott miller , director of market development for the federal energy regulatory commission . " revenues and transactions are occurring normally as far as we can tell . "

enron ' s woes may ripple out to others - - - if energy company files for bankruptcy , results are likely to be messy

the sudden , deep financial troubles of enron corp . , the once aggressive , many - tentacled energy conglomerate , could have widespread consequences for scores of companies across the economy .
if enron files for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , as many investors and financial experts now expect , it is likely to be one of the messiest , most complex bankruptcy cases ever , lawyers say .
that is because of the multifaceted nature of enron ' s once highflying operations , which combined a global energy business with a massive financial - trading operation involving tens of billions of dollars in complex contracts . yesterday , amid the unraveling of a last - ditch merger with dynegy inc . , the company ' s credit was downgraded to " junk " status by rating agency standard & poor ' s corp . enron has about 800 trading partners or creditors .
the stock market , signaling that a bankruptcy filing is expected , hammered enron stock , which was halted for a time yesterday , and knocked lower some of its financial backers ' shares . enron shares closed at 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , or 85 % . enron bonds also fell sharply , dropping to 50 cents on the dollar from around 55 cents , reflecting concerns over how much creditors might receive if the company does seek bankruptcy - court protection . j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , which have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of keeping the enron - dynegy deal alive , also saw their stocks fall . at 4 p . m . in nyse composite trading , j . p . morgan shares were down $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , while citigroup shares were down $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement it has about $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit , and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines .
other companies also disclosed their exposures to enron . exelon corp . , an energy concern in chicago , said its power - trading arm has a direct net exposure to enron of less than $ 10 million , based on its current book of business and existing market prices . exelon said its direct gross exposure based on sales to enron is less than $ 20 million . exelon said this is partly offset by $ 10 million that it owes to enron .
still , while the fallout from a potential bankruptcy filing would be widespread , federal regulators appear little concerned that it could inflict significant damage to the u . s . economy . ( see related article on page al 0 . )
the scale of the enron collapse is huge , experts say . " there is nothing to compare it to , " said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy specialist with coudert brothers in new york . " the business was so large . there were so many different kinds of operating entities under the enron umbrella . "
in a way , he added , a filing would represent all the challenges of two of the biggest bankruptcies in recent years - - this past spring ' s chapter 11 filing by pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric utility unit , and the demise of drexel burnham lambert , the wall street securities firm that failed more than a decade ago . a filing by enron , with about $ 13 billion in debt , would rank among the largest bankruptcy filings ever .
bankruptcy lawyers and creditors ' rights specialists , already swamped with a wealth of work from a boom in chapter 11 filings during the last 18 months , said they had been contacted by worried banks and other lenders to enron , seeking to retain them in the event of a chapter 11 filing . enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company is exploring its options and wouldn ' t comment on whether it has retained bankruptcy counsel .
but lawyers said the company was already in discussions about retaining its own counsel . among the likely advisers is new york law firm weil gotshal the idea is to protect all parties from market risk as the value of those contracts can fluctuate from day to day , and to avoid a larger financial meltdown .
that means enron ' s counterparties are free to close out such transactions , rather than file claims in a bankruptcy proceeding reflecting the total notional amount of any trades . in other words , a securities firm that is a counterparty to enron in many financial contracts would tally up how much it owes enron under such contracts and how much enron owes it , offsetting the amounts against each other . but this process is ripe for conflicts , as disputes easily could arise over the value of the contracts .
" it is an incredibly complex piece of financial engineering , " andrew rahl , a bankruptcy lawyer at anderson kill & olick in new york , said of the process .
how much collateral those counterparties could seize isn ' t at all clear , either . enron was considered very aggressive in negotiating agreements such as swaps , where a party trades an obligation to pay a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate on given securities . the speed with which the company ' s finances have deteriorated further reduces the odds that its trading partners will be able to get paid anytime soon . without any security , counterparty claims would go into the probably massive general pool of claims from unsecured creditors .
besides banks and bondholders , dozens of companies , municipalities and utilities that had signed multiyear power contracts with enron may be left in the lurch . over the years , the likes of retailer j . c . penney co . , and shopping - mall company simon property group , of indianapolis , signed on with enron , as it undercut local utilities in newly deregulated markets .
any bankruptcy also is likely to trigger collateral lawsuits , as aggrieved parties look for alternative deep pockets . one possible target , analysts said , could be advisers that helped enron establish off - balance - sheet vehicles and other debt related to troubled investment partnerships , which have triggered massive losses in recent weeks . moreover , enron directors themselves could be vulnerable , too .
yesterday , enron named raymond s . troubh , a new york financial consultant , to its board as chairman of a newly formed special litigation committee to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits .
at the same time , any filing would give enron some advantages , most notably greater ease in securing financing . this is because once companies file for protection , any new cash infusion from the banks has an overriding claim on any of the company ' s assets , at the expense of previous lenders .
in addition , potential buyers for enron businesses may be more likely to emerge once the company is operating with court protection and the depth of its problems are known .
" there is a certain comfort level that buyers have when buying a business in a chapter 11 case that doesn ' t exist when a company is struggling outside of bankruptcy , " said keith shapiro , a bankruptcy lawyer at greenberg traurig in chicago .

credit markets
why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - s & p cries ` junk , ' but the warning comes too late
by gregory zuckerman and jathon sapsford
staff reporters of the wall street journal

at 10 : 57 a . m . est yesterday , an announcement came out that effectively scuttled dynegy inc . ' s proposed takeover of enron corp . it was issued not by the two companies or their bankers , but by a behind - the - scenes player that was pivotal in the deal from the start .
the news came from standard & poor ' s , which lowered enron ' s credit rating to " junk " status , because of concern about the energy trading company ' s financial condition . the move , followed by similar downgrades by moody ' s investors service inc . and fitch inc . several hours later , prompted dynegy to announce that it was walking away from the multibillion dollar deal .
the downgrades highlight the key role that credit - rating agencies - - which are sometimes only bit players - - are having in one of the biggest wall street dramas in years . before they became deal breakers , the ratings agencies had emerged as unlikely deal makers just a few weeks ago , by leaving enron little choice but to seek a merger partner or face a downgrade that would have made it difficult to keep running its business .
throughout the enron saga , the rating agencies found themselves the target of repeated and intense lobbying by enron , dynegy and their bankers at j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . all tried - - and ultimately failed - - to come up with assurances that the merger would bolster enron and thus protect bondholders and lenders from suffering losses .
the dramatic downgrades are sure to increase scrutiny over the role of the rating agencies in the enron situation . critics say that , in waiting until enron ' s bonds already had plummeted in value , the ratings agencies failed in their job of anticipating a company ' s financial problems and giving investors an early warning .
it now seems clear that the rating agencies , like most securities analysts , seem to have too easily accepted enron ' s murky financial reporting , which gave the impression that the company ' s balance sheet was stronger than it was . as recently as late october , both moody ' s corp . ' s moody ' s and mcgraw - hill cos . ' s & p had a solid investment - grade rating on enron ' s debt .
but since credit - rating agencies often have access to company information that securities analysts often don ' t have , the rating agencies could take some heat for not anticipating the financial difficulties . bond investors , for instance , say s & p was prematurely upbeat about enron ' s outlook earlier this month , and long ago should have demanded more information from the company . " if the rating agencies were privy all along to information that , as near as i can tell , was nonpublic regarding these off - balance - sheet liabilities , then their judgment looks even more faulty , " says carol levenson of gimme credit , a chicago - based analyst .
others wonder whether the ratings executives should have lowered the rating to junk days ago , when enron ' s problems became obvious . while such a move would have crippled the company ' s ability to find a suitor , holding off on the ratings move hurt stock and bond investors left holding the securities .
" i don ' t think the consequences of a rating action should have anything to do with whether one takes that rating action or not , if one feels it ' s warranted , " ms . levenson says . " i don ' t think there was any doubt enron was a junk credit . "
the ratings agencies counter that enron ' s financial condition , while weakened , became precarious only in the past few days , and given the consequences of a downgrade they needed to be prudent .
indeed , every party to the deal - - until yesterday - - kept working to provide financial infusions to enron to keep the deal alive . enron executives were particularly desperate to hold off a ratings downgrade . once the debt was lowered to junk status from investment grade , a whopping $ 3 . 9 billion of debt immediately became due , jeopardizing enron ' s ability to stay afloat .
worries about such a debt downgrade weeks ago pushed enron into the merger with dynegy , despite reservations from some enron executives about whether the deal was right . enron pledged some of its best assets to secure a $ 500 million investment from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup ' s citibank , and agreed to strict terms demanded by banks to get an emergency $ 1 billion credit line from various banks . in recent days , the two companies worked to restructure their merger and to raise still more liquidity for enron .
by 4 p . m . tuesday , the credit agencies agreed to hold off on a downgrade , convinced the two sides were making progress in restructuring the deal and drumming up new money for enron . in a conference call , ron barone , a managing director at s & p , told enron executives he was willing to wait on a decision , aware of the serious consequences of a downgrade .
" we ' ll be very patient and diligent " because of the progress being made , he told them , according to someone familiar with the conversation .
as late as 10 : 30 p . m . tuesday , a new deal still seemed in sight . but at about 2 a . m . yesterday , the talks broke down . instead of being briefed about terms of a new merger agreement , the credit - agency executives became doubtful a resolution would ever be reached .
in a late morning phone call to jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , mr . barone broke the news that the company ' s credit would be downgraded . " we lost confidence the deal would be consummated in a way that would keep the rating intact , " mr . barone says in an interview . " enron ' s credibility and viability continued to diminish . they were aware of our concerns . "
s & p downgraded enron ' s corporate - credit rating two full grades to single - b - minus , near the lower end of the junk - bond world , from triple - b - minus , the lowest investment - grade level . moody ' s lowered the debt to b 2 from baa 3 .
in a late - afternoon conference call with investors , s & p executives said the rating could still be lowered further , on the heels of the official announcement that the merger with dynegy was off .
responding to criticism that the credit agencies should have downgraded enron ' s debt sooner , mr . barone of s & p notes that the rating agency wasn ' t " privy to everything . " still , he adds , until yesterday " we were confident it was an investment - grade company , and that the merger would give it the security to enable enron to function at an investment - grade level . "
on the flip side , of course , if enron is forced into bankruptcy , the rating agencies may well catch heat that their impact was too drastic , effectively killing the deal .
treasurys
treasurys ended slightly higher . at 4 p . m . , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 1 / 32 point , or 31 cents per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 15 / 32 to yield 4 . 938 % . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price also was up 1 / 32 point , at 100 9 / 32 to yield 5 . 355 % .
the dow jones industrial average ended with a loss of 160 . 74 points . investors often shift funds to the relative safety of the government securities market at times when stocks are weak . a treasury sale of $ 21 billion of two - year notes drew less demand than expected . the bid - to - cover ratio , a gauge of demand comparing the dollar value of bids received with those awarded , was 1 . 51 , well below the 2 . 53 average of the past 12 auctions .
also somewhat bearish for the bond market was release of the fed ' s beige book report , an assessment of economic conditions around the country in advance of policy meetings . policy makers are to meet again dec . 11 .
although the report cited weakness in the economy , it didn ' t encourage people in the bond market to expect further rate cuts by the fed , analysts said . " not everybody is in the camp that the fed ' s going to ease again , " said kevin flanagan , market strategist at morgan stanley .
