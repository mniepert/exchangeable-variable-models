new york - ( dow jones ) - , an internet - based energy and metals trading operation , saw record trading volumes last week , due in part to troubles at enron corp . ( ene ) , an ice press release said tuesday , without mentioning enron by name .
investors have been watching to see if enron ' s trading partners in its core business - north american gas and power marketing - significantly reduce activities with the financially troubled top energy marketer . ice is considered a primary alternative to enron ' s internet - based commodities market , enrononline .
ice ' s volume of north american bulk power trades last week totaled a record 54 million megawatt - hours , a 34 % increase over the october weekly average . north american natural gas volumes rose 13 % from october to 950 billion cubic feet last week . oil trading rose 45 % to a record 55 million barrels , and metals trading volumes was up 66 % .
" we believe that this has resulted , in part , from the uncertainty that has been exhibited in several key energy trading venues over the pas several months , " said ice chief executive , jeffry sprecher .
enrononline is different from ice because enrononline is a mechanism for companies to buy from , and sell to , enron . ice is a neutral multiparty exchange , allowing energy trading companies to trade with all other members .
ice ' s trading system , which has been installed in 7 , 000 desktops worldwide , covers 600 commodity and derivative contract types . ice also owns the international petroleum exchange of london , europe ' s largest energy futures exchange .
ice is owned by companies including american electric power ( aep ) , aquila energy ( ila ) , bp amoco plc ( bp ) , deutshe bank ag ( g . dbk ) , el paso corp . ( epg ) , goldman sachs group ( gs ) , morgan stanley dean witter 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com

new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 13 , 2001 - - fitch has lowered portland general electric co . ' s ( pge ) securities as follows : senior secured debt to ' bbb + ' from ' a ' ; senior unsecured debt to ' bbb ' from ' a - ' ; preferred stock to ' bbb - ' from ' bbb + ' . the rating watch status has been revised to evolving from negative for all intermediate - to long - term securities . a rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised , lowered or maintained . pge ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ' f 2 ' from ' fl ' , with a stable outlook .
the downgrades for pge reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent , enron ( ene ) . ene ' s senior unsecured debt is rated ' bbb - ' , with a rating watch evolving . ene ' s financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a result of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structured transactions . on oct . 16 , 2001 , ene announced a $ 1 billion after tax charge to third quarter 2001 earnings and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction to balance sheet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions . in addition , the company has restated its financial results for the 1997 - 2000 period , incorporating off - balance sheet entries related to the structured transactions and is the subject of a securities and exchange commission ( sec ) investigation focusing on the company ' s accounting for the partnerships .
these events badly eroded investor confidence in the company , effectively blocking its ability to access capital markets , and forcing management to seek a corporate suitor . on nov . 9 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire ene in a stock - for - stock transaction under which ene shareholders will receive a fixed amount of dyn shares . the proposed dyn transaction will provide significant financial support to ene , and should enable ene to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expected business conditions , despite ene ' s significant refinancing risk . the merger requires regulatory approvals , including hart - scott - rodino , the sec , and the federal regulatory energy commission ; assuming regulators approve the merger , we would expect the transaction to close in six - to nine - months . the merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an element of uncertainty to its completion . fitch anticipates that the surviving company ' s rating would move to the mid - ' bbb ' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the completion of the merger . if the merger were terminated fitch believes ene ' s ability to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to highly speculative levels .
pge ' s new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile , the prospective regulatory ring - fencing required by oregon regulators , and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas ( nwn ) , in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene . the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene / dyn merger were terminated , or improve , if ene ' s credit rating is upgraded in the future .
pge ' s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in 2001 , reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs . in august 2001 , the oregon public utility commission ( opuc ) authorized higher pge rates , effective october 1 , 2001 , to recover such costs . importantly , the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion ' s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future . the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order , combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in 2002 .
the pge ratings consider fitch ' s assessment of nwn ' s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post - merger holding company structure . nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at $ 2 . 9 billion , including the assumption of $ 1 . 1 billion of pge debt . the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory approvals , including the sec , the opuc , and the washington utilities and transportation commission . as part of the transaction , nwn expects to form a new holding company ( holdco ) , which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge . post - merger , pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco . as currently contemplated , the approximate $ 1 . 8 billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately 78 % debt and 22 % common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock . as a result , holdco ' s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak , as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach 75 % at closing .
pge ' s ultimate post - merger ratings will depend on several factors , including , the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn , the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco , and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators . the current regulatory ring - fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a 48 % common equity ratio , thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company . it is expected that similar ring - fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure .

according to lay ' s contract , the company would also pay his taxes if the annual payments were deemed to be an " excess parachute payment " for income tax purposes .
lay reassumed the posts of president and chief executive in august following the resignation of jeffrey skilling . his enron contract expires on dec . 31 , 2005 .
lay is considered by many as the visionary who presided over enron ' s growth from a medium - sized natural gas pipeline company , created in 1986 in the merger of houston natural gas and internorth , to the world ' s largest and most innovative energy trader .
enron ' s market capitalization has fallen almost $ 19 billion in just the the past month as investor confidence has waned amid a regulatory probe of off - balance - sheet transactions .
dynegy has agreed to acquire enron in a stock swap worth some $ 9 billion , a fraction of what enron was worth a year ago .
shares of enron were up 43 cents , or 4 . 65 percent , at $ 9 . 67 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange .

london , nov 13 ( reuters ) - enron metals said on tuesday it is trading normally with counterparties and customers and will maintain its current role within the market after its u . s . parent company enron corp agreed to be taken over .
" it is business as usual - yesterday was our second highest day in terms of turnover . today looks like it will be up there as well . our clients and counterparties are happy to trade with us , " mike hutchinson , managing director of enron metals ltd , told reuters .

enron corp , which is north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity , agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by problems , including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings , a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and credit rating downgrades .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 13 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy group dynegy wants to buy power stations in europe as it looks to underpin an energy trading business boosted beyond recognition by its audacious takeover of stricken american rival enron .
dynegy europe ' s president and chief executive officer gary cardone said his company would retain its strategy of backing wholesale energy trading with physical assets , rather than adopting enron ' s " pure trading " approach to european energy markets .
" this will be an asset - backed trading business coupled with ( enron ' s ) market - making capabilities , " he told reuters in an interview on tuesday .
" our approach has been different ( to enron ' s ) , " he added . " they have believed in pure trading . we have believed in a very disciplined approach to assets , " he added .
dynegy has agreed to buy its bigger rival enron in a $ 9 billion rescue deal .
the deal , announced last week , came after enron suffered a share - price collapse and damaging credit downgrades triggered by a regulatory probe into off - balance sheet dealings .
cardone said he considered spain , italy , the netherlands and belgium as attractive hunting grounds for assets , though he said dynegy would remain a cautious buyer .
some new entrants to europe ' s liberalising energy markets had overpaid for assets in recent deals , he said .
cardone declined to comment on speculation that dynegy was a bidder for two power stations in britain , bought last month for $ 960 million by u . s . group american electric power co . .
earlier this year dynegy agreed to buy the gas storage business of britain ' s bg group for 421 million pounds ( $ 608 million ) .
no rush to sell enron assets
cardone said dynegy would not rush to dispose of enron assets in europe , which include some power generation .
" our back is not up against the wall to do a fire sale . we will look at each ( enron ) asset individually , " he said .
enron has interests in around 4 , 500 megawatts of electricity generating capacity in italy , spain , poland , turkey and the uk .
on a trading level , cardone said the takeover of enron would lead to consolidation but he declined give details .
both companies have set up offices across europe in recent years as market liberalisation has triggered an increase in energy trading .
including bg ' s storage operation , dynegy has a european staff of about 400 .
enron , which has piled into european energy trading in recent years and has been a major driver of liquidity , has a european staff of around 5 , 000 . the company is among the top gas and power traders in the uk and germany .
cardone said dynegy would operate with only one online trading platform . enron does much of its trading via its enrononline internet platform while dynegy is trying to build liquidity on its own dynegydirect system .
" our initial thoughts are that enrononline is an outstanding platform , " said cardone , adding dynegy might consider selling or renting out its dynegydirect . " we will only work with one portal , " he said . " enrononline was a great concept , although we are not convinced that we are so far behind it with dynegydirect . "
he said dynegy would rebrand enrononline and all enron products . " there will be nothing called enron , all trade marks will be dynegy . "

new york - ( dow jones ) - " noah ' s ark " should be the name of the company that emerges from the planned combination of enron corp . ( ene ) and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , according to energy markets lore these days .
after all , the logic goes , there will be two of everyone .
enron gas and electricity traders aren ' t so sure of that , as job recruiting firms can attest .
" in the past 60 days , the number of resumes from enron personnel has increased substantially , " said william begley , head of the energy and utilities practice at heidrick dynegy ' s operation is staffed by 300 .
" but with a few trimmings here and there you won ' t see a lot of enron traders on the street , unless they don ' t like what they hear from dynegy , " said jack carr managing director of prime energy partnership , a search and recruiting company based in the uk , with an office in greenwich , connecticut .
an experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn $ 125 , 000 - $ 150 , 000 plus a bonus , according to carr .
right now , enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused , according to one trader at another company who wouldn ' t allow his name to be used .
" i think they ' re very nervous , " the trader said . " the enron people think they ' re better than the dynegy people , and the dynegy people think ' we ' re buying them , so we can just pick through their stuff . ' "

usa : ice sets record energy , metals trade volume .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 13 ( reuters ) - the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , an atlanta - based electronic marketplace , said on tuesday it set several new trading records last week and recorded its strongest weekly performance since it began operation 13 months ago .
" there has been a clear shift of energy and metal trading activity during october into ice markets , " ceo jeffrey sprecher said in a statement .
sources said recent concerns over enron corp ' s crumbling credit rating helped divert on - line business to ice .
trading volumes in oil and refined products set a new weekly record of 55 million barrels , or 11 million barrels per day , a 45 percent increase over the october daily average .
north american power volumes totaled a record 54 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) for the week , or almost 11 million mwh per day , a 34 percent gain over october activity .
north american natural gas traded 950 billion cubic feet , a 13 percent rise from october .
ice said the number of natural gas transactions was up more than 30 percent , indicating smaller average trade sizes .
precious metals trading for the week rose 66 percent from october levels , with almost 3 million gold - equivalent ounces trading .
as an open - access marketplace , ice has seen steady gains in liquidity over the last year , with more than 400 of the world ' s largest commodity trading firms now participating .
the ice electronic trading system is installed on over 7 , 000 desktops worldwide and offers traders more than 600 listed commodity and derivative contract types .
products traded on ice include natural gas , power , crude oil and refined products , precious metals and emissions allowances .
contracts include physical delivery as well as financially settled swaps , spreads , differentials and options based on a variety of fixed and floating price indices .
ice was founded last year by bp , deutsche bank , goldman sachs , morgan stanley dean witter , royal dutch / shell , societe generale and totalfinaelf .
additional partners that helped launch the gas trading operation include reliant energy , aquila energy , american electric power , duke energy , el paso energy and mirant .
ice also has offices in new york , houston , chicago , london and singapore .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 13 ( reuters ) - u . s . energy group dynegy said on tuesday it does not expect its planned takeover of rival american group enron to jeopardize its purchase of the natural gas storage business of britain ' s bg group .
" we haven ' t heard from the ( uk ) regulators but i can ' t imagine why the acquisition of enron would change anything for ( bg ) storage , " dynegy europe ' s president and chief executive gary cardone told reuters .
dynegy , which is taking over troubled enron in a $ 9 billion rescue deal , agreed in july to buy bg storage for 421 million pounds ( $ 608 million ) in cash .
but the british government in september said dynegy would have to provide assurances to address potential competition worries about the deal .
a spokesman for uk energy regulator ofgem said it was too early to say whether dynegy ' s takeover of enron would influence the regulator ' s view of the bg storage deal .
dynegy and enron are both significant traders on the uk spot gas market .
bg storage owns 30 wells with five offshore platforms , nine salt caverns , about 19 miles ( 30 km ) of pipelines and an onshore natural gas processing terminal .
cardone said he wanted to boost bg storage ' s industrial customer base to around 60 by the end of next year , from 26 - 30 currently .
" ( bg storage ) will give us the ability to aggregate new volume and the potential for a hub to bring in new gas from norway , " he said .
he said dynegy would look to expand its storage operations on the back of the bg deal . " we will look at all opportunities in storage , " he said .
the ability to store natural gas is becoming more of an issue as the uk ' s ageing gas fields lose swing - the capacity to rapidly change output and thus smooth out demand / supply blips .
