with the stock market telling dynegy inc . that energy trader enron corp . isn ' t worth even half what dynegy has offered to pay , analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which dynegy could bargain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal .
earlier this month , houston - based dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross - town rival in an all - stock deal that currently values enron shares at $ 10 . 85 apiece , or a total of about $ 9 . 2 billion . but in the wake of post - agreement disclosures by enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantially less than expected , the company ' s stock has been hammered . in 1 p . m . trading on the new york stock exchange on friday , enron shares fell 30 cents to $ 4 . 71 . the stock is down 94 % so far this year and far short of the per - share takeover price . dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $ 40 . 40 .
although dynegy and enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated , dynegy does appear to have other options . the agreement with enron contains a broad " material adverse change " clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked .
dynegy officials performed " due diligence " throughout the holiday weekend , seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of enron , which has suffered a series of damaging blows . since mid - october , enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off enron ' s balance sheet , for a time , to several private partnerships . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation . past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an " accounting error " by enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since oct . 16 . at one point , enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings .
an enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed . dynegy spokesman john sousa said the two sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk - away provisions " are broad , by design , to ensure adequate protection for dynegy shareholders . " shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement .
clauses related to a " material adverse change , " also known as a " material adverse effect , " have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year , due , in part , to the stock market ' s fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions .
but such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove . both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal , much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins .
furthermore , a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can ' t easily walk away from a merger . in that case , meat - processing concern tyson foods inc . sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat - packer ibp inc . due to a drop in ibp ' s earnings and a write - down of an ibp subsidiary . but a delaware judge refused to let tyson cancel the pact , saying tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of ibp ' s business and the accounting issue .
in a lengthy june 18 opinion , delaware chancery court vice chancellor leo e . strine jr . wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company has suffered a material adverse effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company ' s earnings power over a commercially reasonable period , which one would think would be measured in years rather than months . "
that interpretation has created ripples in the deal - making community , prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated . since the sept . 11 attacks , for example , a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a " material adverse change , " or mac .
a key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is " whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup , " says meredith brown , co - chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm debevoise & plimpton in new york . he adds that a court " may be skeptical " if dynegy claimed that enron ' s post - merger agreement disclosures were a surprise .
the enron - dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination . enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer , although it is prohibited from soliciting one . in such a case , it could be required to pay a $ 350 million " topper fee " to dynegy and its co - investor , chevrontexaco inc .
dynegy can alter the deal if enron faces " pending or threatened " litigation liabilities that are " reasonably likely " to cost enron $ 2 billion . if those liabilities hit $ 3 . 5 billion " an enron material event will be deemed to have occurred , " presumably allowing dynegy to call the whole thing off . in some situations , dynegy would be liable for a $ 350 million fee , as well .
karen denne , the enron spokeswoman , said her firm doesn ' t believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event . the liability must result from litigation . currently , the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors , issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses .
deal makers who aren ' t involved in the combination say the steep drop in enron ' s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn ' t by itself give dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force enron to renegotiate its terms . instead , they say , dynegy would likely have to prove that enron ' s worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event , which could be difficult in light of the company ' s highly publicized problems and dynegy ' s frequent statement that it clearly understands enron ' s businesses . still , there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow dynegy to terminate the deal if " any representation or warranty of enron shall have become untrue . "
other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stock prices that changed an acquisition premium . western resources inc . of topeka , kansas last week sued public service co . of new mexico seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy western ' s utilities . the lawsuit accused public service of breaching its " duty of good faith and fair dealing " and said the new mexico company tried to " sabotage " the deal as the two companies ' stock prices diverged . public service denies the accusations .

it ' s not easy being no . 4 . despite a $ 35 billion merger completed in october , chevrontexaco corp . is still not one of the oil superpowers . nor , at more than $ 90 billion a year in revenues , is it a scrappy little guy . so chairman david j . o ' reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling for more oil and gas .
now , he may have something : a big stake in the no . 1 energy - trading company . chevron corp . has owned 26 % of dynegy inc . since 1996 , and with dynegy ' s planned acquisition of enron corp . , the top energy trader , chevrontexaco is making the oil industry ' s most aggressive push yet into this fast - growing business . it plans to eventually pump $ 2 . 5 billion into the combined dynegy and enron to maintain its 26 % stake , and it might raise that share . so , while chevrontexaco ' s much bigger rivals run small in - house trading operations , energy trading may soon account for more than 10 % of chevrontexaco ' s earnings . ` ` chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business , ' ' says analyst arjun murti at goldman , sachs the most likely target is a natural - gas company . maybe it ' s not so bad being no . 4 .

as houston - based enron corp . imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finances , few would have blamed dynegy inc . ceo charles l . watson if he had sat back and gloated . after all , watson had watched as his bigger , brasher crosstown rival sniffed at dynegy ' s more cautious strategy , all the while garnering most of the credit for reshaping the energy - trading business .
instead , watson picked up the phone on oct . 24 and called enron chairman , ceo , and longtime acquaintance kenneth l . lay to ask how he could help . lay didn ' t respond immediately , but as enron ' s stock continued to plunge and the company faced a cash squeeze , it became clear what the only realistic answer could be : bail us out .
so two days later , lay invited watson to his river oaks home near downtown houston for breakfast to discuss a deal . over muffins and ` ` a bad cup of coffee ' ' the next day , watson recalls , they sketched the outlines , and by 10 p . m . that night , the investment bankers were called in . on nov . 9 , dynegy announced that it would pay about $ 10 billion , plus the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt , to buy enron , which is nearly four times its size . the key to the deal was dynegy ' s immediate $ 1 . 5 billion infusion of cash to shore up enron ' s balance sheet and save its credit rating . the money came from dynegy ' s 26 % owner , chevrontexaco corp .
without that help , enron - - the seventh - largest u . s . company , based on its $ 100 billion in sales last year - - may well have faced bankruptcy . watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams . ` ` i don ' t think anybody foresaw the problems [ at enron ] , ' ' he says . ` ` it ' s been incredible to watch . ' '
watson , 51 , has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet . if he can pull it off , the new dynegy will have revenues of more than $ 200 billion and $ 90 billion in assets , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of power - generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline . it would control an estimated 20 % to 25 % of the energy - trading market , up from about 6 % now .
that would be sweet vindication for watson ' s strategy . dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants , which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer . in contrast , enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil - and gas - generating fields , believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel , pulp , and paper . irresistible bargain . as enron ' s stock slid below $ 9 from its august , 2000 , high of $ 90 , it became a bargain that watson couldn ' t pass up . it would have taken years for dynegy to build up a market - making operation to match enron ' s . its risk - management systems are top - of - the - line . enron ' s commercial - services unit , which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as wendy ' s international inc . , is three or four years ahead of dynegy ' s , says steve bergstrom , president of dynegy . watson says he still plans to get rid of the $ 8 billion worth of assets lay had earmarked for sale , including the portland ( ore . ) general electric plant and oil and gas assets in india . for the $ 1 . 5 billion , though , if the deal falls through dynegy will have the right to enron ' s prized northern natural gas pipeline , worth an estimated $ 2 . 25 billion . and dynegy can walk away if enron ' s legal liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion .
watson firmly believes that enron suffered from a crisis of confidence , not a meltdown of its core business . indeed , enron ' s wholesale - trading operation earned $ 2 . 3 billion last year . says watson : ` ` we know the business . we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we thought it was . ' '
but the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by enron ' s accounting tricks . the biggest danger for watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away . already , the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997 by $ 591 million , or 20 % of its total , to account for controversial partnerships involving enron officials . the securities some compare it to a fraternity . dynegy ' s decision to issue new stock options to some enron employees may soothe battered egos . it should help , too , that lay decided not to take the $ 60 million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout . as it is , lay will not have a management job with the new company .
dynegy often seemed to be an enron wannabe , following it into online trading and commercial services . still , dynegy ' s 361 % stock gains last year eclipsed enron ' s 87 % rise , and it rankled some that lay ' s execs got more credit . ` ` chuck watson may not have been in the spotlight , but he has always been at the forefront of this business , ' ' says bruce m . withers , who sold his trident ngl inc . to dynegy in 1995 . watson will get more attention next year - - he ' s a 15 % owner of the new houston texans pro football team . but with his bold takeover of enron , watson has ensured that he ' s off the sidelines for good .

confused about earnings ? you ' re not alone . here ' s what companies should do - - and what investors need to know

in an age when giant earnings write - offs have become commonplace , it ' s hard to shock wall street . but on nov . 8 , enron corp . managed to do it . after years of high - octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24 % a year , the houston - based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half - billion dollars . it was confirmation of investors ' worst fears . three weeks earlier , enron had announced a big drop in shareholders ' equity , sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance . management pointed to a number of factors , including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion - dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company ' s net worth .
enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases , but it is hardly alone . this year , corporate america is expected to charge off a record $ 125 billion , much of it for assets , investments , and inventory that aren ' t worth as much as management thought ( chart , page 79 ) . even if companies don ' t go back and restate earnings , as enron is doing , those charges cast doubt on the record - breaking earnings growth of the late ' 90 s .
not since the 1930 s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue - - and so difficult for investors to determine . there ' s more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers . if even the most sophisticated financial minds can ' t figure out what a company actually earns , that has implications far beyond enron . u . s . financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build . it has made the u . s . the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest . it has also ensured ready access to capital for u . s . corporations . that a company such as enron , a member of the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index and one of the largest companies on the new york stock exchange , could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished . ` ` the profession of auditing and accounting is , in fact , in crisis , ' ' says paul a . volcker , former chairman of the federal reserve and now one of the leaders of the international accounting standards board .
sometimes , as in the case of enron , fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings . more often , though , the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways - - and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies , which appear under a variety of names , from ` ` pro forma ' ' to ` ` core . ' ' ( enron offers its own such version . before investors untangled the importance of enron ' s first announcement , its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ` ` recurring net income ' ' had met expectations . ) the resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing : what did my company earn ?
why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place ? because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company ' s prospects . many institutional investors , most wall street analysts , and even many accountants say gaap is irrelevant . ` ` i don ' t know anyone who uses gaap net income anymore for anything , ' ' says lehman brothers inc . accounting expert robert willens . the problem is that gaap includes a lot of noncash charges and one - time expenses . while investors need to be aware of those charges , they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations .
that ' s what operating earnings are supposed to do . but because they ' re calculated in an ad hoc manner , with each company free to use its own rules , comparisons between companies have become meaningless . ` ` no investor - - certainly not any ordinary investor - - can read these in a way that ' s useful , ' ' says harvey l . pitt , chairman of the securities & exchange commission . the sec is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas .
what ' s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income . in the end , investors need two numbers - - a standardized operating number and an audited net - income number - - and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other . ` ` out of hand . ' ' a widespread consensus is building to do just that . in early november , s & p proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings . only the week before , the financial accounting standards board , the rulemakers for gaap , had announced that they , too , would be taking up this issue . volcker says the international accounting standards board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings .
` ` over the past two or three years , the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand , ' ' says david m . blitzer , s & p ' s chief investment strategist . ` ` earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they ' re trying to evaluate a company . if people want to use an operating - earnings measure , we better all know what we ' re looking at . ' '
without those standards in place , the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to wall street is only going to grow wider and more confusing . look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the s & p 500 for the third quarter : it ' s $ 10 . 78 according to wall street analysts as tallied by thomson financial / first call , $ 9 . 17 according to s & p , and $ 6 . 37 according to numbers reported to the sec under gaap . ( s & p , like businessweek , is owned by the mcgraw - hill companies . )
the lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong . use first call ' s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price - earnings ratio of 23 for the s & p 500 . but run the numbers using gaap earnings , and suddenly the market has a far steeper p - e of 38 .
how did we get into this mess ? investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years , and for years , reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it . then came the dot - com bubble , along with increased pressure from wall street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts . suddenly , companies that hadn ' t turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants . these customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit . ` ` tower of babel . ' ' pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company , casting doubt on their validity . and these days , the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever . s & p ' s tallies fall between the two : s & p ' s numbers are more systematic than pro forma , but they aren ' t followed widely enough to be a standard . ` ` investors are facing a tower of babel , ' ' says robert k . elliott , former chief of the american institute of certified public accountants ( aicpa ) and a retired kpmg partner . ` ` it ' s not standardized , and the numbers are not audited . ' '
that makes it tough to evaluate a company ' s performance . in the quarter ended on sept . 30 , nortel networks corp . offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from . by conservative gaap accounting , the telecommunications giant lost $ 1 . 08 a share . the company also provided two possible pro forma options : a 68 cents loss that excluded ` ` special charges , ' ' including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges , and a still better 27 cents loss that further excluded $ 1 . 9 billion of ` ` incremental charges , ' ' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables . wall street chose the rosiest one .
confusing ? you bet . companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they ' re merely filling a void : investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company ' s future . the goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations . ` ` there are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings , ' ' says volcker . ` ` it is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company . ' ' besides , as companies like to point out , they still have to report gaap earnings , and investors are free to ignore everything else .
there ' s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of gaap than the $ 50 billion asset write - downs by jds uniphase corp . , the biggest charge of the year . near the height of the telecom bull market in july , 2000 , the san jose ( calif . ) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor sdl inc . for $ 41 billion in stock . when the deal closed in february , its assets ballooned from $ 25 billion to $ 65 billion . but by then , shares of jds and other fiber - optics makers were collapsing . to bring its acquisitions into line with their new value , the company took charges of $ 50 billion . despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid , gaap required that the charges be taken out of net income . so according to gaap , jds lost $ 56 billion in the fiscal year ending in june - - a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only $ 5 billion .
analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash , the charge - off was all about the past , a right - sizing of values that had gotten out of hand . to analyze the company ' s prospects , they excluded the $ 50 billion charge . ` ` the accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened , ' ' says jds uniphase chief financial officer anthony r . muller , ` ` and we ' ll live with the consequences , whatever they are . ' ' analysts make a similar defense . ` ` my goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company , ' ' says lehman brothers analyst arnab chanda . glacial pace . are jds ' s pro forma numbers realistic - - a fair gauge of jds ' s ongoing operations ? right now , it ' s hard for investors to judge . and that ' s the kind of ambiguity s & p and others would like to eliminate . in november , s & p circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings . under the proposal , operating earnings would include the costs of purchases , research and development , restructuring costs ( including severance ) , write - downs from ongoing operations , and the cost to the company of stock options . it would exclude merger - and - acquisition expenses , impairment of goodwill , litigation settlements , and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset .
when s & p applied roughly that formula to jds uniphase , it split the difference between wall street and gaap . because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations , the results were chaotic . using gaap , the company lost $ 9 . 39 a share . s & p figures it lost $ 3 . 19 , while the company put the loss at 36 cents . meanwhile , wall street says it made 2 cents .
the s & p standard may make sense , but it raises the question : where is the financial accounting standards board , the group in charge of gaap ? chairman edmund l . jenkins says fasb will be addressing the problems . still , investors shouldn ' t expect any improvement soon . the pace of change at fasb tends to be glacial . it typically takes four years to complete a new standard . in 1996 , for example , the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda . in june , 2000 , the board finally issued a draft of a new standard , asked for comments , and held a public hearing . in october , 2001 , the board said it still wasn ' t ready to put a fix in place . now , the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges , and the fasb still doesn ' t have new rules .
the slow pace means the standard - setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market . the most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on september 11 . an fasb task force , unable to come up with a set of rules for separating september 11 costs from general expenses , instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item . so gaap earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company ' s general performance . many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press re
