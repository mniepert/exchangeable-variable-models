enron corp . , looking to convince wall street that it can cope with an escalating financial crisis , has held initial discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies for a capital infusion of at least $ 2 billion , people familiar with the matter say .
the houston energy concern , unable to tap the public capital markets at a time when it needs to shore up its balance sheet , has approached such big - name buyout firms as blackstone group and clayton , dubilier & rice to gauge their interest . enron seeks a cash infusion in exchange for an equity stake in enron , among other terms . in addition , a number of companies involved in power trading , a core business for enron , have expressed an interest in making an investment . the identity of the companies making overtures couldn ' t be determined . prominent energy companies with power - trading operations include anglo - dutch oil concern royal dutch / shell group , dynegy inc . , duke energy corp . , of charlotte , n . c . , reliant energy inc . , of houston , and el paso corp . , also of houston . another well - known investor from outside the industry was approached but declined enron ' s offer .
enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected . mostly , though , it needs to restore its credibility with wall street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up . one potential financier is general electric co . ' s ge capital unit , which also has been approached by enron . ge , of fairfield , conn . , has no interest in an outright takeover of enron , but it could take on a small stake or make a financing commitment and it has had discussions to that effect , according to one person familiar with the matter . ge declined comment .
" you would expect everybody that is in the business and understands power trading would make a phone call , " one person familiar with the matter said . a capital infusion would be one way to help restore enron ' s credibility with wall street , as it would show that the so - called smart money is willing to bet on a turnaround . enron chairman kenneth lay is eager to secure a deal as early as this week , these people say .
an enron representative declined to comment , as did a spokesman for dynegy . spokesmen for blackstone and clayton , dubilier & rice declined comment .
enron has been rocked by last month ' s disclosure of a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by enron ' s former chief financial officer . last month , it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million . the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter . last week , enron secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines , using gas - pipeline assets as collateral .
enron ' s stock price has tumbled in line with the developments , falling more than 60 % since mid - october . at 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron was down 13 cents at $ 11 . 17 .
yesterday , ratings concern fitch inc . downgraded enron ' s senior unsecured debt to triple - b - minus from triple - b - plus . enron ' s senior unsecured debt now is rated just a notch above junk bond , or high - yield , status . last week , standard & poor ' s corp . lowered its credit rating on enron to triple - b , while moody ' s investors service lowered its rating to baa 2 .
given such high - profile problems , the declining stock price and potential for further sec action , any investors likely would insist on a close scrutiny of enron ' s finances and may seek board seats in exchange for a stake . one potential investor said his firm was unlikely to make a commitment unless enron offered terms that were too good to pass up .
" it is inherently risky to invest in a company that is under investigation , when the outcome of that investigation is unknown , " said joel papernick , a partner in new york at mintz , levin , cohn , ferris , glovsky and popeo , a law firm that isn ' t involved in the matter .
any transaction likely would take the form of a convertible - preferred stake , in which an investor receives a safe , bond - like interest payment and then can convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a specified level . it also is possible that enron would enter such transactions with more than one party . for instance , a $ 2 billion investment may be too big for one private - equity firm , so enron may need to get a couple of potential investors on board . another way to shield an investor ' s risk could be for a private - equity firm to invest in an asset owned by enron instead of investing in the parent company .
analysts are divided as to whether enron will seek an investment from a private equity firm or a company that already is in the power - trading business . some analysts say the most logical investor would be someone who already understands the deregulated energy markets that enron helped pioneer . there also are social factors that could influence whose infusion of cash , ultimately , is accepted .
dynegy long has been regarded as an enron " wannabe , " because it has a history of following moves that enron has made . after enron purchased the portland general electric utility in 1997 , dynegy made a successful bid to buy illinova corp . which it acquired in february 2000 . after enron launched its successful internet - based commodities trading platform , enrononline , in november 1999 , dynegy developed its rival dynegydirect platform .
one big difference between the two companies is that enron has pursued an " asset light " strategy in recent years , trying to control the output of gas fields and power plants without actually owning them . dynegy has been much more comfortable owning hard assets and was a big purchaser of power plants in california in 1998 , for example .
the two companies , with headquarters in downtown houston , are seen as die - hard rivals . that could make it difficult for mr . lay to accept any overture from dynegy chairman chuck watson . dynegy ' s largest single investor is chevrontexaco corp . , of san francisco , which has profited handsomely from a 28 % equity stake in dynegy .
an overture from coral energy , royal dutch shell ' s marketing and trading unit , might receive a more receptive response from enron , some onlookers say .
coral isn ' t one of the biggest energy traders , but it carries a triple - a rating that is unusual for an energy - trading concern . coral acts as the exclusive marketer of shell ' s north american natural - gas production , as well as for the power generation , gas pipeline and gas - storage assets controlled by intergen , a joint venture of shell and bechtel group inc . , the big san francisco engineering and consulting firm .

pg & e corp , the owner of pacific gas & electric , yesterday said that wholesale power prices had stabilised in california , and its reorganisation was progressing well .
this suggests the worst might be over in the state ' s power crisis , which sent prices soaring and dragged pg & e into bankruptcy .
enron , the us energy trader , which is among pg & e ' s 30 , 000 creditors and is owed $ 500 m , also said recently that the california situation was improving .
pg & e filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april after it amassed nearly $ 9 bn in debt by buying power on the open market at sharply higher prices that it could not pass on to customers .
pg & e corp yesterday said that the cost of buying electricity for pg & e dropped 69 per cent to $ 697 m in the third quarter , from $ 2 . 23 bn a year ago .
the average price of power in california is 75 per cent lower than in the year - ago quarter .
" prices have stabilised as we predicted they would . if customers can see the true cost of power then they will regulate themselves , " said a pg & e corp spokesman .
" now , usage is down and prices have come down , " he added .
the lower electricity costs helped pg & e corp to more than treble its third - quarter net income to $ 771 m , or $ 2 . 12 a share , from $ 225 m , or 62 cents a share a year ago .
sales fell 16 per cent to $ 6 . 3 bn , from $ 7 . 5 bn .
peter rigby , utilities analyst at standard & poor ' s , the credit rating agency , yesterday said that there was " guarded optimism " that the trend of lower wholesale prices would continue .
pg & e corp said it hoped to learn before the year - end that its restructuring plan filed in september was " reasonable " . the plan is to split the parent and the utility into stand - alone companies , with the transfer of some assets to pg & e ' s unregulated units .
ratepayers , however , fear that such a move would take pg & e as well as another utility , southern california edison , out of the oversight of the state regulatory body , the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) .
kenneth lay , chairman of enron , said recently that a settlement with the cpuc to keep edison out of bankruptcy was good news for the california power situation .

dabhol power company , the indian arm of the troubled enron energy group , yesterday moved closer to abandoning its role in a controversial $ 2 . 9 bn power project near bombay .
dpc said it was preparing to hand over the 2 , 184 mw asset to its sole customer , maharashtra state electricity board , and would demand compensation based on an independent valuation .
bankers said that , under the terms of the contract , mseb was obliged to buy the distressed asset because it had defaulted on payments , the cause of a breakdown in relations between the two parties .
yesterday mseb said it refused to take " cognisance " of dpc ' s issue of a " notice of asset transfer " because the indian company had withdrawn from the contract six months ago , an act of defiance which dpc says was invalid .
mseb ceased taking power from the plant in may , alleging contractual misrepresentation . phase one of the complex is complete and the second stage was approaching completion before the dispute effectively killed off work .
" this notice formally sets in motion the valuation process of dabhol ' s assets in connection with the termination of the power purchasing agreement , " dpc said yesterday .
the us company ' s initiative yesterday comes days before it can legally issue a final termination notice on the $ 2 . 9 bn power project and amid a flurry of financial diplomacy by the project ' s indian and foreign lenders to salvage the country ' s biggest foreign direct investment .
indian financial institutions , which carry a large exposure to the project as lenders and as guarantors of foreign loans , are under pressure to find a solution ahead of the visit by atal behari vajpayee , indian prime minister , to washington this week .
enron ' s move runs parallel to efforts by kenneth lay , chairman of the houston - based company , to seek full compensation of about $ 1 bn for itself and two smaller us equity holders , general electric and bechtel . the fourth and final equity holder is mseb , which holds a 15 per cent stake .
